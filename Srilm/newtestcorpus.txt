<unk> starred in the <year> film mercenaries directed by paris <unk>
along with li bai li po he is frequently called the greatest of the chinese poets
his greatest ambition was to serve his country as a successful civil servant but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations
his life like the whole country was devastated by the an <unk> rebellion of <num> and his last <num> years were a time of almost constant unrest
although initially he was little @-@ known to other writers his works came to be hugely influential in both chinese and japanese literary culture
of his poetic writing nearly fifteen hundred poems have been preserved over the ages
he has been called the poet @-@ historian and the poet @-@ sage by chinese critics while the range of his work has allowed him to be introduced to western readers as the chinese virgil horace ovid shakespeare milton burns wordsworth <unk> hugo or <unk>
since many of du fu 's poems feature morality and history this practice is particularly important
another reason identified by the chinese historian william hung is that chinese poems are typically concise omitting context that might be relevant but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know
for modern western readers the less accurately we know the time the place and the circumstances in the background the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly and the result will be that we either misunderstand the poem or fail to understand it altogether
stephen owen suggests a third factor particular to du fu arguing that the variety of the poet 's work required consideration of his whole life rather than the <unk> <unk> used for more limited poets
his paternal grandfather was du <unk> a noted politician and poet during the reign of empress wu
du fu was born in <num> the exact birthplace is unknown except that it was near luoyang henan province gong county is a favourite candidate
in later life he considered himself to belong to the capital city of chang 'an ancestral hometown of the du family
du fu 's mother died shortly after he was born and he was partially raised by his aunt
he had an elder brother who died young
he also had three half brothers and one half sister to whom he frequently refers in his poems although he never mentions his stepmother
the son of a minor scholar @-@ official his youth was spent on the standard education of a future civil servant study and <unk> of the confucian classics of philosophy history and poetry
he later claimed to have produced <unk> poems by his early teens but these have been lost
in the early <num> he travelled in the <unk> zhejiang area his earliest surviving poem describing a poetry contest is thought to date from the end of this period around <num>
in that year he took the civil service exam likely in chang 'an
he failed to his surprise and that of centuries of later critics
hung concludes that he probably failed because his prose style at the time was too dense and obscure while chou suggests his failure to cultivate connections in the capital may have been to blame
after this failure he went back to traveling this time around shandong and hebei
his father died around <num>
du fu would have been allowed to enter the civil service because of his father 's rank but he is thought to have given up the privilege in favour of one of his half brothers
he spent the next four years living in the luoyang area fulfilling his duties in domestic affairs
in the autumn of <num> he met li bai li po for the first time and the two poets formed a friendship
david young describes this as the most significant formative element in du fu 's artistic development because it gave him a living example of the reclusive poet @-@ scholar life to which he was attracted after his failure in the civil service exam
the relationship was somewhat one @-@ sided however
du fu was by some years the younger while li bai was already a poetic star
we have twelve poems to or about li bai from the younger poet but only one in the other direction
they met again only once in <num>
in <num> he moved to the capital in an attempt to resurrect his official career
he took the civil service exam a second time during the following year but all the candidates were failed by the prime minister apparently in order to prevent the emergence of possible rivals
he never again attempted the examinations instead <unk> the emperor directly in <num> <num> and probably again in <num>
he married around <num> and by <num> the couple had had five children — three sons and two daughters — but one of the sons died in infancy in <num>
from <num> he began to have lung problems probably asthma the first of a series of ailments which <unk> him for the rest of his life
it was in that year that du fu was forced to move his family due to the turmoil of a famine brought about by massive floods in the region
in <num> he received an appointment as <unk> of the right commandant 's office of the crown prince 's palace
although this was a minor post in normal times it would have been at least the start of an official career
even before he had begun work however the position was swept away by events
it caused enormous disruption to chinese society the census of <num> recorded <num>
<num> million people but ten years later the census counted just <num>
<num> million the remainder having been displaced or killed
during this time du fu led a largely itinerant life unsettled by wars associated <unk> and imperial displeasure
this period of unhappiness was the making of du fu as a poet even shan chou has written that what he saw around him — the lives of his family neighbors and strangers – what he heard and what he hoped for or feared from the progress of various campaigns — these became the enduring themes of his poetry
even when he learned of the death of his youngest child he turned to the suffering of others in his poetry instead of dwelling upon his own <unk>
du fu wrote brooding on what i have lived through if even i know such suffering the common man must surely be rattled by the winds
in <num> emperor <unk> was forced to flee the capital and abdicate
du fu who had been away from the city took his family to a place of safety and attempted to join the court of the new emperor <unk> but he was captured by the rebels and taken to chang 'an
in the autumn his youngest son du <unk> baby bear was born
around this time du fu is thought to have contracted malaria
he escaped from chang 'an the following year and was appointed reminder when he rejoined the court in may <num>
this post gave access to the emperor but was largely ceremonial
du fu 's <unk> compelled him to try to make use of it he caused trouble for himself by protesting the removal of his friend and patron fang guan on a petty charge
he was arrested but was pardoned in june
he was granted leave to visit his family in september but he soon rejoined the court and on december <num> <num> he returned to chang 'an with the emperor following its recapture by government forces
however his advice continued to be <unk> and in the summer of <num> he was demoted to a post as commissioner of education in <unk>
the position was not to his taste in one poem he wrote i am about to scream <unk> in the office especially when they bring more papers to pile higher on my desk
he moved on in the summer of <num> this has traditionally been ascribed to famine but hung believes that frustration is a more likely reason
he next spent around six weeks in <unk> now <unk> gansu province where he wrote more than sixty poems
he departed on december <num> for chengdu sichuan province where he was hosted by local prefect and fellow poet <unk> di
du subsequently based himself in sichuan for most of the next five years
by the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances
he was relieved by yan wu a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at chengdu
despite his financial problems this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life
many of du 's poems from this period are peaceful depictions of his life at thatched hut
in <num> he left the city to escape a rebellion but he returned in summer <num> when he was appointed an advisor to yan who was involved in campaigns against the <unk> empire
they traveled slowly held up by his ill @-@ health by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight <unk> and general old age in addition to his previous ailments
they stayed in <unk> in what is now <unk> <unk> at the entrance to the three gorges for almost two years from late spring <num>
this period was du fu 's last great poetic flowering and here he wrote <num> poems in his dense late style
in autumn <num> bo <unk> became governor of the region he supported du fu financially and employed him as his unofficial secretary
in march <num> he began his journey again and got as far as hunan province where he died in <unk> now <unk> in november or december <num> in his <num> year
he was survived by his wife and two sons who remained in the area for some years at least
his last known descendant is a grandson who requested a grave inscription for the poet from yuan <unk> in <num>
hung <unk> his life by concluding that he appeared to be a filial son an affectionate father a generous brother a faithful husband a loyal friend a <unk> official and a patriotic subject
below is an example of one of du fu 's later works to my retired friend wei chinese <unk>
the most directly historical of his poems are those commenting on military tactics or the successes and failures of the government or the poems of advice which he wrote to the emperor
indirectly he wrote about the effect of the times in which he lived on himself and on the ordinary people of china
as watson notes this is information of a kind seldom found in the officially compiled histories of the era
du fu 's political comments are based on emotion rather than calculation his <unk> have been paraphrased as let us all be less selfish let us all do what we are supposed to do
since his views were impossible to disagree with his forcefully expressed <unk> enabled his installation as the central figure of chinese poetic history
one of the earliest surviving works the song of the wagons from around <num> gives voice to the sufferings of a conscript soldier in the imperial army and a clear @-@ sighted consciousness of suffering
these concerns are continuously articulated in poems on the lives of both soldiers and civilians produced by du fu throughout his life
although du fu 's frequent references to his own difficulties can give the impression of an all @-@ consuming <unk> hawkes argues that his famous compassion in fact includes himself viewed quite objectively and almost as an afterthought
he therefore lends grandeur to the wider picture by comparing it to his own slightly comical triviality
du fu 's compassion for himself and for others was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment
zhang jie wrote that for du fu everything in this world is poetry du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life calligraphy paintings animals and other poems
chinese critics traditionally used the term <unk> <unk> complete symphony a reference to <unk> description of confucius
yuan <unk> was the first to note the breadth of du fu 's achievement writing in <num> that his predecessor united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly
he mastered all the forms of chinese poetry chou says that in every form he either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples
furthermore his poems use a wide range of registers from the direct and colloquial to the <unk> and self @-@ consciously literary
this variety is manifested even within individual works owen identifies the rapid stylistic and thematic shifts in poems which enable the poet to represent different facets of a situation while chou uses the term juxtaposition as the major analytical tool in her work
du fu is noted for having written more on poetics and painting than any other writer of his time
he wrote eighteen poems on painting alone more than any other tang poet
du fu 's seemingly negative commentary on the prized horse paintings of han gan ignited a controversy that has persisted to the present day
the tenor of his work changed as he developed his style and adapted to his surroundings chameleon @-@ like according to watson his earliest works are in a relatively derivative courtly style but he came into his own in the years of the rebellion
owen comments on the grim simplicity of the <unk> poems which mirrors the desert landscape the works from his chengdu period are light often finely observed while the poems from the late <unk> period have a density and power of vision
although he wrote in all poetic forms du fu is best known for his <unk> a type of poem with strict constraints on form and content for example about two thirds of du fu 's <year> extant works are in this form and he is generally considered to be its leading exponent
his best <unk> use the <unk> required by the form to add expressive content rather than as mere technical restrictions
hawkes comments that it is amazing that tu fu is able to use so immensely stylized a form in so natural a manner
in his lifetime and immediately following his death du fu was not greatly appreciated
in part this can be attributed to his stylistic and formal innovations some of which are still considered extremely daring and bizarre by chinese critics
there are few contemporary references to him — only eleven poems from six writers — and these describe him in terms of affection but not as a <unk> of poetic or moral ideals
du fu is also poorly represented in contemporary anthologies of poetry
however as hung notes he is the only chinese poet whose influence grew with time and his works began to increase in popularity in the ninth century
early positive comments came from bai <unk> who praised the moral sentiments of some of du fu 's works although he found these in only a small fraction of the poems and from han yu who wrote a piece defending du fu and li bai on aesthetic grounds from attacks made against them
both these writers showed the influence of du fu in their own poetic work
by the beginning of the <num> century wei <unk> constructed the first replica of his thatched cottage in sichuan
it was in the <num> century during the northern song era that du fu 's reputation reached its peak
in this period a comprehensive re @-@ evaluation of earlier poets took place in which wang wei li bai and du fu came to be regarded as representing respectively the buddhist <unk> and confucian strands of chinese culture
at the same time the development of neo @-@ confucianism ensured that du fu as its poetic <unk> occupied the paramount position
su shi famously expressed this reasoning when he wrote that du fu was preeminent
because
through all his vicissitudes he never for the space of a meal forgot his sovereign
his influence was helped by his ability to reconcile apparent opposites political conservatives were attracted by his loyalty to the established order while political radicals embraced his concern for the poor
literary conservatives could look to his technical mastery while literary radicals were inspired by his innovations
since the establishment of the people 's republic of china du fu 's loyalty to the state and concern for the poor have been interpreted as embryonic nationalism and socialism and he has been praised for his use of simple people 's language
du fu 's popularity grew to such an extent that it is as hard to measure his influence as that of shakespeare in england it was hard for any chinese poet not to be influenced by him
while there was never another du fu individual poets followed in the traditions of specific aspects of his work bai <unk> 's concern for the poor lu you 's patriotism and <unk> <unk> 's reflections on the <unk> are a few examples
more broadly du fu 's work in transforming the <unk> from mere word play into a vehicle for serious poetic utterance set the stage for every subsequent writer in the genre
in the <num> century he was the favourite poet of kenneth <unk> who has described him as the greatest non @-@ epic non @-@ dramatic poet who has survived in any language and commented that he has made me a better man as a moral agent and as a perceiving organism
even in modern japanese the term saint of poetry <unk> <unk> is mostly synonymous with du fu
until the <num> century the japanese preferred bai <unk> above all poets and there were few references to du fu although his influence can be seen in some <unk> chinese poetry made by japanese poets anthologies such as <unk> <unk> in the <num> century
the first notable japanese <unk> of du fu 's poetry was <unk> <unk> <num> – <num> a <unk> zen patriarch and one of the most prominent authors of the literature of the five mountains he highly praised du fu and made a commentary on some poems of du fu from the perspective of a zen priest in vol
<num> of <unk>
his student <unk> <unk> composed many <unk> which were clearly stated influenced by du fu in their prefaces
<unk> 's student <unk> <unk> had close connection with the court and <unk> <unk> and propagated du fu 's poetry in the mundane world one day <unk> <unk> the <unk> regent of the court and the highest authority of <unk> poetry asked <unk> should i learn the poetry of du fu and li bai <unk> dared to reply yes if you do have enough capability
no if do not
since then there had been many seminars on du fu 's poetry both in zen temples and in the aristocratic society and as a result his poetry was often cited in japanese literature in the <unk> period e
g
<unk> a historical epic in the late <num> century and some noh plays such as <unk> <unk> and <unk>
during the kan 'ei era of the edo period <year> – <year> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the ming dynasty 's collective commentary on du fu 's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was imported into japan and it gained explosive popularity in confucian scholars and <unk> townspeople class
the commentary established du fu 's fame as the highest of all poets for instance hayashi <unk> a notable confucian scholar commented in vol
<num> of <unk> <unk> that <unk> du fu was the very best poet in history and praised <unk> <unk> 's commentary for its simplicity and readability while he criticized old commentaries during the yuan dynasty were too unfathomable
<unk> <unk> the greatest haiku poet was also strongly influenced by du fu in <unk> no <unk> his masterpiece he cites the first two lines of a spring view <unk> before a haiku as its introduction and also many of his other haiku have similar wording and themes
it is said that when he died in osaka during a long travel a copy of du fu 's poetry was found with him as one of a few precious items which he was able to carry around
as burton watson remarks in the selected poems of du fu there are many different ways to approach the problems involved in translating du fu which is why we need as many different translations as possible p
<unk>
the translators have had to contend with bringing out the formal constraints of the original without sounding laboured to a western ear particularly when translating regulated verse or <unk> and accommodating the complex allusions contained particularly in the later works hawkes writes that his poems do not as a rule come through very well in translation — p
ix
one extreme on each issue is represented by kenneth <unk> 's one hundred poems from the chinese
his are free translations which seek to conceal the <unk> through <unk> and expansion and contraction of the content his responses to the allusions are firstly to omit most of these poems from his selection and secondly to translate out the references in those works which he does select
other translators have placed much greater weight on trying to convey a sense of the poetic forms used by du fu
vikram seth in three chinese poets uses english @-@ style rhyme schemes whereas keith <unk> in facing the moon approximates the chinese rhyme scheme both use end @-@ stopped lines and preserve some degree of parallelism
in the selected poems of du fu burton watson follows the <unk> quite strictly persuading the western reader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa
similarly he deals with the allusion of the later works by combining literal translation with extensive <unk>
in <year> stephen owen published translations with facing chinese texts of the complete poetry of du fu in six volumes with extensive scholarly apparatus which emphasized <unk>

originally intended to be repeats of the preceding <unk> class they were redesigned before construction began
both ships carried supplies for the survivors of the great <unk> earthquake in <year>
they were modernized in <year> – <num> with improvements to their armour and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style
afterwards they played a minor role in the second sino @-@ japanese war
despite the expensive reconstructions both vessels were considered obsolete by the eve of the pacific war and neither saw significant action in the early years of the war
following the loss of most of the <unk> 's large aircraft carriers during the battle of midway in mid @-@ <year> they were rebuilt with a flight deck replacing the rear pair of gun turrets to give them the ability to operate an air group of <unk>
a lack of aircraft and qualified pilots however meant that they never actually operated their aircraft in combat
while awaiting their air group the sister ships were sometimes used to ferry troops and material to japanese bases
they participated in the battle of cape <unk> in late <year> where they <unk> the american carrier fleet supporting the invasion of leyte away from the landing beaches

the <unk> 's fleet of battleships had proven highly successful in <year> the last year of the russo @-@ japanese war which culminated in the destruction of the russian second and third pacific squadrons at the battle of <unk>
in the aftermath the japanese empire immediately turned its focus to the two remaining rivals for imperial dominance in the pacific ocean britain and the united states
<unk> <unk> a japanese navy admiral and military theorist speculated that conflict would inevitably arise between japan and at least one of its two main rivals
to that end he called for the japanese navy to maintain a fleet with at least <num> as many capital ships as the us navy
this ratio <unk> theorized would enable the imperial japanese navy to defeat the us navy in one major battle in japanese waters in any eventual conflict
accordingly the <year> imperial defence policy called for the construction of a battle fleet of eight modern battleships <num> @,@ <num> long tons <num> @,@ <num> t each and eight modern armoured cruisers <num> @,@ <num> long tons <num> @,@ <num> t each
this was the genesis of the eight @-@ eight fleet program the development of a cohesive battle line of sixteen capital ships
the launch of hms dreadnought in <year> by the royal navy raised the stakes and complicated japan 's plans
displacing <num> @,@ <num> long tons <num> @,@ <num> t and armed with ten <num> @-@ inch <num>
<num> cm guns dreadnought rendered all existing battleships obsolete by comparison
the launch of the battlecruiser hms invincible the following year was a further setback for japan 's quest for parity
when the two new <unk> @-@ class battleships and two <unk> @-@ class armoured cruisers launched by <year> were outclassed by their british counterparts the eight @-@ eight fleet program was restarted
the first battleships built for the renewed eight @-@ eight fleet program were the two dreadnoughts of the <unk> class ordered in <year> and laid down in <year>
in <year> the navy put forward a request to the diet parliament to secure funding for the entirety of the program at once
because of economic constraints only four battlecruisers and a single battleship of the <unk> class were ultimately approved by the diet
three more <unk> @-@ class ships <unk> <unk> and <unk> were approved and all three were ordered in april <year>
while <unk> was laid down later that year the <unk> lacked the funding to proceed with the construction of <unk> and <unk> until the diet authorized additional funding for the ships in july <year>
the distribution of the midships gun turrets was the most obvious flaw as they complicated the protection of the midships magazine and exposed more of the ship to the blast effects of the guns when they fired
another issue was that japanese sailors had problems maintaining a high rate of fire with the <num>
<num> @-@ kilogram <num>
<num> lb shells used in the manually loaded <num> @-@ millimetre <num> in secondary guns used in the <unk> class and earlier designs
to resolve this issue the <unk> designed a smaller <num> @-@ millimetre <num>
<num> in gun that offset its lighter shell weight with a higher rate of fire
it also decided that the barbette armour of the earlier ships was too thin and wanted a modest increase in speed to partially counter the higher speeds of the latest foreign ships like the british queen elizabeth @-@ class battleships and russian <unk> @-@ class battlecruisers
for financial reasons more powerful engines could not be ordered so the new design was lengthened slightly and the boiler rooms enlarged to increase speed by <num>
<num> knots <num>
<num> km h <num>
<num> mph to <num> knots <num> km h <num> mph
to save weight the forecastle deck was shortened so that the lower midships gun turret was lower than in the <unk> class
this reduced the crew 's accommodations despite a significant increase in the crew 's numbers and naval historian <unk> <unk> believed that these ships had the worst <unk> of any japanese capital ship
the final design was designated a @-@ <num> by the <unk> and differed enough from the a @-@ <num> design of the <unk> class that it was considered a separate class
the ships had a length of <num>
<num> metres <num> ft <num> in overall a beam of <num>
<num> metres <num> ft <num> in and a draught of <num>
<num> metres <num> ft <num> in at deep load
they displaced <num> @,@ <num> long tons <num> @,@ <num> t at deep load roughly <num> long tons <num> t more than the preceding class
their crew consisted of <num> @,@ <num> officers and enlisted men
they had a metacentric height of <num>
<num> metres <num> ft <num>
<num> in at deep load
during the ships modernization during the <num> their forward <unk> were enlarged with multiple platforms added to their tripod <unk>
both ships were also given torpedo <unk> to improve their underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armour
in addition their <unk> were lengthened by <num>
<num> metres <num>
<num> ft
these changes increased their overall length to <num>
<num> metres <num> ft their beam to <num>
<num> metres <num> ft <num> in and their draft to <num>
<num> metres <num> ft <num> in
their displacement increased over <num> @,@ <num> long tons <num> @,@ <num> t to <num> @,@ <num> long tons <num> @,@ <num> t at deep load
the crew now numbered <num> @,@ <num> officers and enlisted men
<num> @-@ metre <num> ft <num> in propellers
the high @-@ pressure turbines drove the wing shafts while the low @-@ pressure turbines drove the inner shafts
the turbines were designed to produce a total of <num> @,@ <num> or <num> @,@ <num> shaft horsepower <num> @,@ <num> or <num> @,@ <num> kw <unk> and <unk> respectively using steam provided by <num> <unk> <unk> <unk> water @-@ tube boilers at working pressures of <num> – <num>
<num> kg cm2 <num> @,@ <num> – <num> @,@ <num> kpa <num> – <num> psi
both ships comfortably exceeded their designed speed of <num> knots <num> km h <num> mph during their sea trials <unk> reached <num>
<num> knots <num>
<num> km h <num>
<num> mph from <num> @,@ <num> shp <num> @,@ <num> kw and <unk> exceeded that with <num> knots <num> km h <num> mph from <num> @,@ <num> shp <num> @,@ <num> kw
each of the boilers consumed a mixture of coal and oil and the ships had a stowage capacity of <num> @,@ <num> long tons <num> @,@ <num> t of coal and <num> @,@ <num> long tons <num> @,@ <num> t of fuel oil which gave them a range of <num> @,@ <num> nautical miles <num> @,@ <num> km <num> @,@ <num> mi at a speed of <num> knots <num> km h <num> mph
<unk> and <unk> had three generators of <num> kilowatts <num> hp capacity and two <num> @-@ <unk> <num> hp turbo generators at <num> volts
during their <num> modernization the boilers on each ship were replaced by eight new <unk> oil @-@ fired boilers fitted into the former aft boiler room and the forward funnel was removed
the turbines were replaced by four geared <unk> turbines with a designed output of <num> @,@ <num> shp <num> @,@ <num> kw intended to increase their speed to <num>
<num> knots <num>
<num> km h <num>
<num> mph
on her trials <unk> reached a top speed of <num>
<num> knots <num>
<num> km h <num>
<num> mph from <num> @,@ <num> shp <num> @,@ <num> kw
the fuel storage of the ships was increased to a total of <num> @,@ <num> long tons <num> @,@ <num> t of fuel oil that gave them a range of <num> @,@ <num> nautical miles <num> @,@ <num> km <num> @,@ <num> mi at a speed of <num> knots <num> km h <num> mph
<num> cm <num>
<num> in type <num> guns of the <unk> class were mounted in three pairs of twin @-@ gun superfiring turrets
numbered one through six from front to rear each turret weighed <num> long tons <num> t
the hydraulically powered turrets had an elevation capability of − <num> <num> degrees
the guns had a rate of fire of <num>
<num> – <num> rounds per minute and could be loaded at any angle between <num> and <num> degrees
in <year> the elevation was increased to <num> degrees and then to <num> degrees during their mid @-@ <num> modernization except for no
<num> turret as its supporting structure could not be lowered
the recoil mechanism of the guns was also changed from a hydraulic to a pneumatic system which allowed for a faster firing cycle of the main guns
by world war ii the guns used type <num> armour @-@ piercing capped shells
each of these shells weighed <num>
<num> kilograms <num> @,@ <num> lb and was fired at a muzzle velocity of <num> – <num> metres per second <num> @,@ <num> – <num> @,@ <num> ft s
they had a maximum range of <num> @,@ <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> yd at <num> degrees of elevation and <num> @,@ <num> meters <num> @,@ <num> yd at <num> degrees after modernization
also available was a <num> @-@ kilogram <num> @,@ <num> lb high @-@ explosive shell that had a muzzle velocity of <num> metres per second <num> @,@ <num> ft s
a special type <num> <unk> incendiary shrapnel shell was developed in the <num> for anti @-@ aircraft use
the ships secondary armament consisted of twenty <num> @-@ calibre <num> @-@ <unk> type <num>
eighteen of these were mounted in casemates in the forecastle and superstructure and the remaining pair were mounted on the deck above them and protected by gun shields
they had a maximum elevation of <num> degrees which gave them ranges of <num> @,@ <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> yd
each gun had a rate of fire of up to <num> rounds per minute
anti @-@ aircraft defence was provided by four <num> @-@ calibre <num> year type <num> @-@ <unk> aa guns in single mounts
the <num>
<num> @-@ <unk> <num> in high @-@ angle guns had a maximum elevation of <num> degrees and had a rate of fire of <num> to <num> rounds per minute
they fired a <num> kg <num> lb projectile with a muzzle velocity of <num> m s <num> @,@ <num> ft s to a maximum height of <num> @,@ <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> ft
the ships were also fitted with six submerged <num>
<num> @-@ <unk> <num>
<num> in torpedo tubes three on each broadside
they carried twelve to eighteen <num> year type torpedoes which had a <num> @-@ kilogram <num> lb warhead
they had three settings for range and speed <num> @,@ <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> yd at <num> knots <num> km h <num> mph <num> @,@ <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> yd at <num> knots <num> km h <num> mph or <num> @,@ <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> yd at <num> knots <num> km h <num> mph
in <year> – <num> the aa guns were replaced with eight <num> @-@ caliber <num>
<num> cm <num>
<num> in type <num> dual @-@ purpose guns fitted on both sides of the forward <unk> in four twin @-@ gun mounts
when firing at surface targets the guns had a range of <num> @,@ <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> yd they had a ceiling of <num> @,@ <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> ft at their maximum elevation of <num> degrees
their maximum rate of fire was <num> rounds a minute but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute
two twin @-@ gun mounts for license @-@ built vickers two @-@ pounder light aa guns were also added
these guns had a maximum elevation of <num> degrees and a rate of fire of <num> rounds per minute
the pair of <num> cm guns on the upper deck were removed at this time
during the mid @-@ <num> reconstruction the torpedo tubes were removed and the vickers two @-@ pounders were replaced by twenty license @-@ built hotchkiss <num> mm type <num> light aa guns in <num> twin @-@ gun mounts
this was the standard japanese light aa gun during world war ii but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon
according to historian mark <unk> the twin and triple mounts lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets the gun exhibited excessive vibration the magazine was too small and finally the gun produced excessive muzzle blast
these <num> @-@ millimetre <num>
<num> in guns had an effective range of <num> @,@ <num> – <num> @,@ <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> – <num> @,@ <num> yd and an effective ceiling of <num> @,@ <num> metres <num> @,@ <num> ft at an elevation of <num> degrees
the maximum effective rate of fire was only between <num> and <num> rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen @-@ round magazines
in addition the forward pair of <num> cm guns in the forecastle were removed at this time and the maximum elevation of the remaining guns was increased to <num> degrees
<num> in of vickers cemented armour amidships below it was a <unk> of <num> mm <num>
<num> in armour
the upper armoured deck consisted of two layers of high @-@ tensile steel <num> mm <num>
<num> in thick and the lower armoured deck also consisted of two layers of high @-@ tensile steel but only <num> mm <num>
<num> in thick
the sides of this deck sloped downwards to meet the bottom of the lower <unk> of the belt armour
the ends of the belt armour were closed off by bulkheads that ranged in thickness from <num> to <num> mm <num> to <num> in
the turrets were protected with an armour thickness of <num> mm <num> in on the face and <num> mm on the roof
the casemate armour was <num> mm <num>
<num> in thick and that of the barbettes was <num> mm thick rather than the originally planned <num> mm
the sides of the conning tower were <num> mm thick
the <unk> class were the only japanese battleships to place the powder magazine above the shell magazine as the <unk> wished to put as much space as possible between the highly flammable propellant and mine and torpedo <unk>
the danger from plunging shells at long distances was not appreciated until the fatal magazine explosions of three british battlecruisers during the <year> battle of jutland graphically demonstrated the point
to further protect the magazines the depth of the double bottom was increased to a total of <num>
<num> metres <num> ft <num> in underneath the barbettes and magazines
additionally the vessels contained <num> watertight compartments to preserve <unk> in the event of battle damage
in addition to the torpedo bulge added when the ships were modernized the deck armour over the machinery and magazines was increased to a total thickness of <num> mm
inside the original skin of the ships two torpedo bulkheads were also added and the turret roofs were increased to a total of <num> millimetres <num> in of armour
no computer was fitted at that time and data from the rangefinders had to be processed manually
turrets <num> <num> and <num> were built with imported <num> @-@ metre <num> ft <num> in <unk> <unk> rangefinders
these were felt to be inferior to the british barr stroud instruments used on other ships and were removed in <year>
they were replaced by either the british rangefinders or domestically built instruments of <num> or <num> metres <num> ft <num> in or <num> ft <num> in length
in the late <num> the fire @-@ control systems were upgraded and additional platforms were added to the foremast to accommodate them
a pair of directors for the <num>
<num> cm aa guns were added one on each side of the forward superstructure in the early <num>
the fire @-@ control systems were again upgraded in the mid @-@ <num> and directors were added for the <num> mm aa guns
both ships had <num> @-@ metre <num> ft <num> in rangefinders installed at the top of the pagoda mast at that time
type <num> air @-@ search radars were installed aboard the sisters in mid @-@ <year>
<num> in <year>
it was replaced by a platform on turret no
<num> for a <unk> <unk> reconnaissance floatplane in <year> – <num>
a catapult and a <unk> <num> @-@ <unk> <num>
<num> @-@ long @-@ ton crane were fitted on the stern during the mid @-@ <num> modernization and the ships were equipped to operate three <unk> although no hangar was provided
the initial nakajima <unk> biplanes were replaced by nakajima <unk> biplanes in <year>
the loss of four japanese aircraft carriers during the battle of midway in june <year> severely limited the ability of the <unk> to provide any air cover and alternatives were sought
earlier proposals to convert one or more battleships into carriers had been made and rejected at the beginning of the war but they were revived after midway
plans for more elaborate conversions were rejected on the grounds of expense and most critically time and the <unk> settled on removing the rear pair of turrets and replacing them with a flight deck equipped with two catapults to launch <unk>
the <unk> @-@ class ships were selected for the conversion because <unk> had suffered an explosion in turret no
<num> in early may that virtually destroyed the turret and their turret no
<num> could not elevate to the full <num> degrees deemed necessary for the long @-@ range engagement anticipated by the <unk>
the <unk> were scheduled to follow once the first two were completed
all of the <num> cm guns were removed and the casemate openings sealed off
four additional twin <num>
<num> cm mounts were added one pair abreast the funnel and the other abreast the conning tower
the original ten twin <num> mm gun mounts were replaced by triple mounts and nine new triple mounts were added a total of <num> guns
two each type <num> and type <num> aa directors were added to control the additional guns
the ammunition for these new guns was stored in the magazines originally used for the <num> cm guns and for turret no
<num>
during <year> the ships aa defences were reinforced with an additional dozen triple and eleven single <num> mm gun mounts for a total of <num> barrels and a pair of type <num> early warning radars were added
in september six <num> @-@ round aa rocket launchers were added on the sides of the flight deck
the flight deck was <num> metres <num> ft <num> in wide at its forward end and <num> metres <num> ft <num> in at the stern
it <unk> the stern and increased the overall length of the ships to <num>
<num> metres <num> ft <num> in
a pair of rotating gunpowder @-@ propelled catapults were fitted on the sides of the hull forward of the aft superstructure where they partially restricted the arc of fire of the two amidships turrets
they could launch aircraft up to <num> @,@ <num> kilograms <num> @,@ <num> lb in weight and required <num> seconds to launch each aircraft
the flight deck had eight permanent storage positions connected by rails to the catapults and the hydraulically operated aircraft lift that brought the aircraft up from the hangar below on the trolleys used to move the <unk> about
two aircraft were intended to be stowed on the catapults and three more in temporary positions on the flight deck for a total of thirteen
the <num> @-@ metre @-@ long <num> ft <num> in hangar was <num> metres <num> ft <num> in wide forward and <num> metres <num> ft <num> in at the rear
it was <num> metres <num> ft <num> in high and designed to <unk> nine aircraft
it was fitted with fire fighting foam and carbon dioxide <unk> as a result of wartime experience
the t <unk> lift was <num>
<num> metres <num> ft <num> in wide at its forward end and <num>
<num> metres <num> ft <num> in wide at the its aft end
it was <num>
<num> metres long and had a capacity of <num> tonnes <num>
<num> long tons
petrol storage tanks with a capacity of <num> tonnes <num> long tons were installed in the former magazine of turret no
<num> to provide each aircraft with enough fuel for three sorties
to recover the aircraft the <unk> crane formerly on the stern was moved up to the port side of the flight deck
another crane was intended on the starboard side but it was never fitted
the ships had an air group of <num> each of <unk> <unk> dive bombers allied reporting name judy and <unk> <unk> reconnaissance aircraft allied reporting name paul both aircraft had development problems and neither air group ever had all of its intended aircraft
coupled with a shortage of trained pilots neither ship ever used its aircraft during combat
the protection of the former was strengthened by the addition of a concrete wall at least <num> metre <num> ft <num> in in thickness and some of the armour removed from the turrets was used to protect the latter
the double bottom below the former positions of aft turrets was converted to hold fuel oil this increased the ships endurance to <num> @,@ <num> nautical miles <num> @,@ <num> km <num> @,@ <num> mi at a speed of <num> knots
a pair of type <num> surface @-@ search radars were also fitted during the conversion
the removal of the secondary armament the rear turrets and their supporting structures was generally compensated by the addition of the flight deck hangar aa guns and more fuel and the metacentric height increased
<num> metres <num>
<num> in to <num>
<num> metres <num> ft <num> in at full load as a result of the reduction in the displacement by over <num> @,@ <num> tonnes <num> @,@ <num> long tons to <num> @,@ <num> tonnes <num> @,@ <num> long tons
this also reduced the draught to <num>
<num> metres <num> ft <num> in
the overhang of the flight deck at the stern increased the overall length to <num>
<num> metres <num> ft <num> in and the beam was slightly reduced to <num>
<num> metres <num> ft <num> in
<unk> had an explosion in one of her main gun turrets that killed <num> men and injured <num> in <year> the following year she accidentally collided with and sank a schooner losing two crewmen
before the start of the pacific war both ships frequently exercised off the coasts of the soviet union korea and china in addition to training in japanese waters
<unk> hosted edward prince of wales and his aide @-@ de @-@ camp lieutenant louis mountbatten in <year> during the prince 's visit to japan
in korea bay when the <year> great <unk> earthquake struck they sailed to <unk> where they loaded supplies from for the victims on <num> september
together with two other battleships and a pair of light cruisers <unk> sank the destroyer <unk> in <year> during gunnery practice
<unk> 's aa armament was upgraded in <year> and <unk> 's two years later
the latter ship was modernized in <year> – <num> and <unk> in <year> – <num> both at kure naval arsenal
during the second sino @-@ japanese war the sisters frequently patrolled the chinese coast in support of the blockade imposed by japan
in august <year> <unk> ferried two battalions of special naval landing forces to port arthur
three years later she served as the flagship for the emperor of the puppet state of <unk> henry pu @-@ yi during his state visit to japan in june <year>
on <num> november the ships were transferred to the <num> battleship division of the 1st fleet
the sisters were refitted in late <year> in preparation for war which included the fitting of external <unk> <unk> and additional aa directors
on <num> march <year> <unk> and <unk> sortied from their anchorage at <unk> to join the unsuccessful search for the american carrier force that had attacked marcus island a week earlier
similarly they pursued but did not catch the american carriers that had launched the <unk> raid on <num> april
during gunnery training on <num> may there was a premature detonation in the left gun of <unk> 's turret no
<num> that disabled both guns and killed <num> crewmen
both aft magazines were flooded to <unk> the resulting fire and save the ship
she received temporary repairs during which the turret was removed and replaced by a circular armour plate on which three triple <num> mm gun mounts were positioned
on <num> may a valve in <unk> 's no
<num> engine room stuck in the open position and flooded the engine room
while under repair at kure both ships received prototype type <num> radars
commanded by vice @-@ admiral <unk> <unk> the <num> battleship division set sail with the aleutian support group on <num> may at the same time that most of the imperial fleet began an attack on midway island operation mi
they returned home on <num> june and the <unk> began preliminary planning to replace the lost carriers with hybrid carriers converted from battleships
the sisters were selected for conversion and detached from the division on <num> july in preparation
they remained on standby alert until the actual conversions began
<unk> was converted at kure naval arsenal from <num> february to <num> september <year> and <unk> at <unk> naval arsenal from <num> may to <num> november
after completing her sea trials <unk> was attached to the imperial japanese naval academy at <unk> and ferried troops and munitions to the naval base at <unk> in october
in november the ship began working up joined by the newly completed <unk> the following month and both rejoined the <num> battleship division
on <num> may <year> the sisters were transferred to rear admiral <unk> <unk> 's reformed fourth carrier division of the <num> fleet
the division 's <num> naval air group was formed that same day and conducted its first catapult launches in late june
the japanese plan for the defence of the philippines envisioned that the surviving carriers would be used to lure the american carrier forces away from the invasion area to a position where the carriers could be attacked by land @-@ based aircraft and the transports by the rest of the <unk>
the other carrier air groups were not in much better shape and the japanese decided to retain the aircraft ashore for use against the american carriers
the fourth carrier division was assigned to the northern force under the command of vice admiral <unk> ozawa and the sisters sailed from <unk> on <num> october
on the morning of <num> october the bulk of the few aircraft aboard were launched to attack the american carriers as a distraction
they inflicted no damage and caused the americans to search in the direction from which they had attacked
the americans finally spotted the japanese carriers at <num> <num> some <num> miles <num> km east of cape <unk> the northeastern tip of luzon
the american carriers were spread out and it was very late in the day to launch an airstrike so admiral william <unk> commander of the third fleet decided to mass his carriers in a position to attack the following morning
ozawa reversed course during the night correctly believing that the americans would follow him north
although they had lost contact during the night the americans did find the japanese carriers at <num> <num>
they had already launched an airstrike of <num> aircraft that was orbiting <num> miles <num> km ahead of the american carriers while waiting for the japanese ships to be located
this was just the first of a total of five airstrikes that the americans launched that day
the sisters were not heavily engaged by the early airstrikes which are focusing on the group 's aircraft carriers
<unk> claimed to have shot down five attacking dive bombers from the second wave and one small bomb detonated on turret no
<num>
<unk> was lightly damaged by near misses that rupture some hull plating in her bulge and pepper her superstructure with splinters
she took on a <num> @-@ degree list that was quickly corrected before she was ordered to tow the crippled carrier <unk> to safety
her attempt was unsuccessful and <unk> had to be abandoned to her fate
<unk> was attacked by <num> @-@ odd aircraft from the fourth wave but they failed to inflict any serious damage
she dodged <num> torpedoes and was only hit by a bomb once on the bulge <unk> of the port catapult
some <num> other bombs near missed her spraying her with splinters and ruptured some hull plates that contaminated some fuel oil and caused leaks in her port boiler rooms
while an exact total of her casualties is not available it has been estimated that <num> men were killed and some <num> – <num> crewmen were wounded during this attack
<unk> was unsuccessfully attacked by an american submarine at <num> <num>
around <num> <num> ozawa learned about a force of destroyers and cruisers that drove off the japanese destroyers rescuing survivors from some of the carriers lost earlier in the day and sank <unk>
he ordered the fourth carrier division to reverse course and engage the americans but the battleships were unable to find them and ozawa ordered them to reverse course and head for <unk> <unk>
when they arrived on <num> october ozawa transferred to <unk> and hoisted his flag aboard her
while en route for kure the division was unsuccessfully attacked by another submarine
in early november the catapults were removed from both ships and they loaded troops and munitions later that month
while en route they were diverted to the <unk> islands upon reports of heavy air raids at manila
after off @-@ loading their cargo they sailed for <unk> island near singapore on <num> november
they transferred to cam <unk> bay french indochina and <unk> became flagship of the <num> fleet there on <num> december
the division sailed for singapore on <num> december and vice admiral <unk> <unk> transferred his flag to the light cruiser <unk> on arrival there the following day
the division continued onwards to <unk>
its planned return to japan was delayed by attacks by the american third fleet on targets in indochina and southern china that sank two oil tankers that were intended to refuel the division
the <unk> then decided to use the sisters and their escorts to bring a load of petrol rubber tin and other strategic minerals back to japan after the american carriers departed the south china sea operation <unk>
they loaded their cargoes beginning on <num> february at singapore and departed four days later
also carrying some <num> @,@ <num> <unk> workers they were escorted by <unk> and three destroyers
decrypted japanese radio signals revealed the japanese plan to the allies and <num> submarines were positioned along their anticipated route in an attempt to intercept and sink the ships
an additional <num> were moved into position while the group was en route but only three were ultimately able to attack
none of them were successful before the japanese reached kure on <num> february
the fourth carrier division was disbanded on <num> march and the sisters were reduced to 1st rank reserve ships
on <num> march kure was attacked by aircraft from task force <num> and <unk> was hit three times by bombs that killed <num> men and wounded <num>
her gunners claimed to have shot down one american dive bomber during the attack
<unk> was hit twice during the attack but her casualties if any are unknown
the ships were turned into floating aa batteries over the next several months although it <unk> them little when they were attacked again by american carrier aircraft in july
on the <num> <unk> was struck by five bombs and near missed multiple times all told she lost <num> crewmen killed and many others wounded
the bombs started numerous leaks and <unk> began to settle by the bow although she was returned to an even keel after three @-@ days pumping
<unk> was a primary focus of the attack and she received <num> direct hits and up to <num> near misses
she was badly damaged with some <num> @-@ odd crewmen killed and <num> wounded during the attack
she slowly foundered over the next two days and was not attacked when the americans returned four days later
this time it was <unk> 's turn and she was struck <num> or more times with many near misses that put her on the bottom in shallow water with a <num> degree list
the sisters were struck off the navy list in november and their wrecks were scrapped after the war

petoskey posted significant football accomplishments in <year> making <year> a significant year for himself as well
achieving all @-@ american status as an end at michigan would be <unk> 's next step after excelling in <unk> competition
the united press syndicate ran a feature article about <unk> in september <year> that opened as follows another great end has made his appearance on the big ten football horizon in the person of dick <unk> <num> @-@ year @-@ old michigan freshman
every so often a great offensive end comes along a player who has to learn how to play defense but who has the natural speed smooth actions height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver

it is not clear why <unk> did not finish higher
however it is fairly clear that sportswriters of that era had a bias against michigan
in the associated press poll at the end of the <year> season the notre dame fighting irish were ranked ahead of the university of michigan though both teams were undefeated

it was a part of the battle of pusan perimeter and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously
the battle ended in a victory for the united nations after large numbers of united states us and republic of korea rok troops repelled a strong north korean attack
after the first battle of naktong bulge the us army 's <num> infantry division was moved to defend the naktong river line
the division which was untried in combat was struck with a strong attack by several divisions of the korean people 's army which crossed the river and struck all along the division 's line
the force of the attack split the us <num> infantry division in half and the north koreans were able to penetrate to <unk> promoting a fight there
the urgency of the threat to pusan perimeter prompted the us marine corps 1st provisional marine brigade to be brought in to reinforce the us army troops
in two weeks of heavy fighting the us forces were able to force the north koreans out of the naktong bulge region
the north koreans were further repulsed after the un counterattack at inchon which culminated in the virtual destruction of the north korean army
the north korean strategy was to aggressively pursue un and rok forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively attacking from the front and initiating a double <unk> of both flanks of the unit which allowed the north koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force which would then be forced to retreat in disarray often leaving behind much of its equipment
from their initial june <num> offensive to fights in july and early august the north koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any un force and push it south
however when the un forces under the eighth united states army established the pusan perimeter in august the un troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which north korean troops could not flank and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior un logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the un army
when the north koreans approached the pusan perimeter on august <num> they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter
throughout august the <unk> <num> division and later the <unk> <num> division engaged the us <num> infantry division at the battle of <unk> initially repelling a un counteroffensive before countering with battles at <unk> @-@ ni and battle mountain
these attacks stalled as un forces well equipped and with plenty of reserves repeatedly repelled north korean attacks
north of <unk> the <unk> <num> division and the us <num> infantry division sparred in the naktong bulge area
in the first battle of naktong bulge the north korean division was unable to hold its bridgehead across the river as large numbers of us reserve forces were brought in to repel it and on august <num> the <unk> <num> division was forced back across the river with <num> percent casualties
in the taegu region five north korean divisions were repulsed by three un divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the battle of taegu
particularly heavy fighting took place at the battle of the bowling alley where the <unk> <num> division was almost completely destroyed in the attack
on the east coast three more north korean divisions were repulsed by the south koreans at p 'ohang @-@ dong during the battle of p 'ohang @-@ dong
all along the front the north korean troops were reeling from these defeats the first time in the war their strategies were not working
instead they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle
fed by intelligence from the soviet union the north koreans were aware the un forces were building up along the pusan perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle
a secondary objective was to surround taegu and destroy the un and rok units in that city
as part of this mission the north korean units would first cut the supply lines to taegu
on august <num> the north korean commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units
the north koreans called for a simultaneous five @-@ <unk> attack against the un lines
these attacks would overwhelm the un defenders and allow the north koreans to break through the lines in at least one place to force the un forces back
five battle groupings were ordered
the center attack called for the <unk> <num> division <unk> <num> division <unk> <num> division and <unk> <num> division break through the us <num> infantry division at the naktong bulge to <unk> and <unk>
on the <num> regiment 's right flank just north of the confluence of the nam river and the naktong river was the us <num> infantry regiment us <num> infantry division
there in the southernmost part of the <num> infantry division zone the <num> infantry regiment held a sector more than <num> @,@ <num> yards <num> @,@ <num> m long including the bulge area of the naktong where the first battle of naktong bulge had taken place earlier in august
each us infantry company on the river line here had a front of <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> m to <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m and they held only key hills and observation points as the units were extremely spread out along the wide front
during the last week of august us troops on these hills could see minor north korean activity across the river which they thought was north koreans organizing the high ground on the west side of the naktong against a possible american attack
there were occasional attacks on the <num> infantry 's forward positions but to the men in the front lines this appeared to be only a standard patrol action
on august <num> the un forces were alerted to a pending attack when much of the korean civilian labor force fled the front lines
intelligence officers reported an attack was coming
on the west side of the naktong north korean major general pak <unk> sam commanding the <unk> <num> division issued his operations order to the division on august <num>
its mission in the forthcoming attack was to outflank and destroy the us troops at naktong bulge by capturing the <unk> and <unk> areas to cut off the us <num> division 's route of supply and withdrawal between taegu and pusan
however the north koreans weren 't aware that the us <num> infantry division had recently replaced the us <num> infantry division in positions along the naktong river
consequently they expected lighter resistance the <num> troops were exhausted from months of fighting but the <num> division men were fresh and newly arrived in korea
they had only recently been moved into the line
the north koreans began crossing the naktong river under cover of darkness at certain points
the river road from <unk> @-@ ri running west along the naktong passes the southern tip of this ridge and crosses to the west side of the river at the ferry
a small village called <unk> lay at the base of hill <num> and <num> yards <num> m from the river
a patrol of tanks and armored vehicles together with two infantry squads of a company <num> infantry held a roadblock near the ferry and close to <unk>
on the evening of august <num> a company moved from its ridge positions overlooking <unk> and the river to new positions along the river below the ridge line
that evening sergeant ernest r
<unk> led the patrol of two <num> <unk> tanks and two <num> gun motor carriages in <unk>
<unk> placed his patrol on the west side of <unk> near the <unk> ferry
at <num> <num> a heavy fog covered the river and at <num> <num> mortar shells began falling on the american @-@ held side of the river
by <num> <num> this strike intensified and north korean mortar preparation struck a company 's positions
american mortars and artillery began firing <unk>
some of the a company men reported they heard noises on the opposite side of the river and splashes in the water
at <num> <num> the fog lifted and <unk> saw that a north korean pontoon bridge was being laid across the river directly in front of his position
<unk> 's four vehicles attacked this structure and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed and the <unk> boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk
at <num> <num> a small arms fight flared around the left side of a company north of the tanks
this gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the a company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise
<unk> 's patrol was then ambushed by a group of north koreans dressed in us military uniforms
<unk> was wounded and the other three vehicles had to withdraw but he held the <unk> site until <num> <num> the next morning with his single tank
in the attack against a company the north koreans hit the 1st platoon which was near <unk> but they did not find the <num> platoon northward
the <unk> <num> division 's infantry crossing of the naktong and attack on its east side near midnight quickly overran the positions of c company north of a company
there the north koreans assaulted in force signaled by green flares and blowing of whistles
the company held its positions only a short time and then attempted to escape
many of the men moved south a few of them coming into a company 's ridge line positions near <unk> during the night
most of c company moved all the way to the <num> division positions south of the naktong
on september <num> that division reported that <num> men of c company had come into its lines
<num> km north of <unk> and a company 's position b company <num> infantry held a similar position on hill <num> overlooking the <unk> ferry crossing of the river
this ferry was located at the middle of the naktong bulge where the <unk> road came down to the naktong and crossed it
the us <num> infantry division had planned a reconnaissance mission to start from there the night of august <num> the same night that the <unk> i corps offensive rolled across the river
near the end of the month two reconnaissance patrols from the <num> infantry had crossed to the west side of the naktong and observed north korean tank and troop activity <num> miles <num>
<num> km west of the river
information obtained later indicated it was in fact the command post of the <unk> <num> division
on august <num> <num> infantry commander colonel john g
hill outlined projected operation <unk> which was to be a company @-@ sized combat patrol to cross the river advance to the suspected north korean command post and communications center destroy it capture prisoners and collect intelligence
the <num> infantry regiment had planned task force <unk> on orders from the <num> division commander major general laurence b
<unk> which in turn had received instructions from eighth united states army commander lieutenant general walton walker for aggressive patrolling
<unk> decided the patrol should cross the river at the <unk> ferry
the <num> infantry reserve e company reinforced with one section of light machine guns from h company was to be the attack force
the 1st platoon <num> engineer combat battalion was to transport it across the river in assault boats the night of august <num>
two heavy weapons companies d and h were each to furnish one section of heavy machine guns one section of <num> @-@ mm
mortars and one section of <num> @-@ mm
recoilless rifles for supporting fires
a platoon of <num>
<num> @-@ inch mortars was also to give support
after dark on august <num> first lieutenant charles i
caldwell of d company and first lieutenant edward <unk> of h company <num> infantry moved their men and weapons to the base of hill <num> which was within b company 's defense sector and overlooked the <unk> ferry crossing of the naktong river
the raiding force e company was still in its regimental reserve position about <num> miles <num>
<num> km west of <unk> getting ready with the engineer platoon to move to the crossing site
colonel hill went forward in the evening with the <num>
<num> @-@ inch mortar platoon to its position at the base of hill <num> where the <unk> prepared to set up their weapons
by <num> <num> the closest front line unit was b company on top of hill <num> <num> mile <num>
<num> km north of the river road which curved around the hill 's southern base
the regimental <unk> captain lewis b
sheen had gone forward in the afternoon to b company to hold services
on top of hill <num> <unk> sheen and men in b company after dark heard splashing in the water below them
they soon discovered a long line of north korean soldiers wading the river
the first north korean crossing at the <unk> ferry caught the heavy mortar platoon unprepared in the act of setting up its weapons
it also caught most of the d and h company men at the base of hill <num>
<num> miles <num>
<num> km from the crossing site
the north koreans killed or captured many of the troops there
hill was there but escaped to the rear just before midnight together with several others when the division canceled operation <unk> because of the attacks
the first heavy weapons carrying party was on its way up the hill when the north korean attack engulfed the men below
it <unk> on to the top where the advance group waited and there all hastily dug in on a small perimeter
this group was not attacked during the night
from <num> <num> until shortly after midnight the <unk> <num> division crossed the naktong at a number of places and climbed the hills quietly toward the <num> infantry river line positions
then when the artillery barrage preparation lifted the north korean infantry were in position to launch their assaults
these began in the northern part of the regimental sector and quickly spread southward
at each crossing site the north koreans would overwhelm local un defenders before building pontoon bridges for their vehicles and armor
at <num> <num> b company was attacked
a truck stopped at the bottom of the hill a whistle sounded then came a shouted order and north korean soldiers started climbing the slope
the hills on both sides of b company were already under attack as was also hill <num> a rugged terrain feature a <num>
<num> miles <num>
<num> km from the river and the north koreans principal immediate objective
the north koreans apparently were not aware of the task force <unk> group lower down on the hill and it was not attacked during the night
but higher up on hill <num> the north koreans drove b company from its position inflicting very heavy casualties on it
sheen led one group of soldiers back to friendly lines on <num> september
at <num> <num> <num> september the <num> infantry regiment ordered its only reserve e company to move west along the <unk> @-@ naktong river road and take a blocking position at the pass between cloverleaf hill and <unk> @-@ ni ridge <num> miles <num>
<num> km from the river and <num> miles <num>
<num> km from <unk>
this was the critical terrain where so much heavy fighting had taken place in the first battle of the naktong bulge
fighting began at the pass at <num> <num> when an american medium tank of a company <num> tank battalion knocked out a t @-@ <num> at <unk> also called <unk>
e company never reached its blocking position
a strong north korean force surprised and delivered heavy automatic fire on it at <num> <num> from positions astride the road east of the pass
the company suffered heavy casualties including the company commander and <unk> 's aide who had accompanied the force
with the critical parts of cloverleaf hill and <unk> @-@ ni ridge the best defensive terrain between <unk> and the river the north koreans controlled the high ground
the us <num> infantry division now had to base its defense of <unk> on relatively poor defensive terrain the low hills at the western edge of the town
on august <num> the <num> regiment was in a new sector of which it had only a limited knowledge
it took over a <num> @,@ <num> yards <num> @,@ <num> m naktong river front without its <num> battalion which had been attached to the us 1st cavalry division to the north
colonel paul l
freeman the regimental commander deployed the 1st battalion on the high ground along the river with the three companies abreast
the 1st battalion under us lieutenant colonel claire e
<unk> jr
<unk> the hills with platoons and squads
he placed the <num> battalion in a reserve position <num> miles <num> km behind the 1st battalion and in a position where it commanded the road net in the regimental sector
on august <unk> the <num> division moved e company south to a reserve position in the <num> infantry sector
two roads ran through the regimental sector from the naktong river to <unk>
the main road bent south along the east bank of the river to <unk> @-@ ni and then turned northeast to <unk>
a northern secondary road curved around marshland and lakes the largest of which was lake u @-@ p 'o to <unk>
in effect the 1st battalion of the <num> regiment guarded these two approach routes to <unk>
the <num> men of the <num> platoon b company <num> infantry held outpost positions on seven hills covering a <num> @,@ <num> yards <num> @,@ <num> m front along the east bank of the naktong north of <unk> @-@ ni
across the river in the rice paddies they could see in the afternoon of august <num> two large groups of north korean soldiers
occasionally artillery fire dispersed them
just before dark the platoon saw a column of north koreans come out of the hills and proceed toward the river
they immediately reported to the battalion command post
the artillery forward observer who estimated the column at <num> @,@ <num> people thought they were refugees
freeman immediately ordered the artillery to fire on the column reducing its number
however the north koreans continued their advance
at <num> <num> the first shells of what proved to be a two @-@ hour north korean artillery and mortar preparation against the american river positions of <num> platoon
as the barrage rolled on north korean infantry crossed the river and climbed the hills in the darkness under cover of its fire
at <num> <num> the barrage lifted and the north koreans attacked <num> platoon forcing it from the hill after a short fight
similar assaults took place elsewhere along the battalion outpost line
on the regimental left along the main <unk> @-@ ni @-@ <unk> road north korean soldiers completely overran c company by <num> september <num>
only seven men of c company could be accounted for and three days later after all the stragglers and those cut off behind north korean lines had come in there were only <num> men in the company
as the north korean attack developed during the night 1st battalion succeeded in withdrawing a large part of its force less c company just north of lake u @-@ p 'o and the hills there covering the northern road into <unk> <num> miles <num>
<num> km east of the river and <num> miles <num>
<num> km west of the town
b company lost heavily in this action
when word of the disaster that had overtaken 1st battalion reached regimental headquarters freeman obtained the release of g and f companies from <num> division reserve and sent the former to help 1st battalion and the latter on the southern road toward <unk> @-@ ni and c company
major lloyd k
jenson executive officer of the <num> battalion accompanied f company down the <unk> @-@ ni road
this force was unable to reach c company but jenson collected stragglers from it and seized high ground astride this main approach to <unk> near <unk> 'o @-@ ri above lake <unk> and went into a defensive position there
the us <num> division released e company to the regiment and the next day it joined f company to build up what became the main defensive position of the <unk> regiment in front of <unk>
north korean troops during the night passed around the right flank of 1st battalion 's northern blocking position and reached the road three miles behind him near the division artillery positions
the <num> infantry headquarters and service companies and other miscellaneous regimental units finally stopped this penetration near the regimental command post <num> miles <num>
<num> km northwest of <unk>
<unk> decided that this situation made it advisable to control and direct the divided division as two special forces
accordingly he placed the division artillery commander brigadier general loyal m
haynes in command of the northern group
haynes command post was <num> miles <num> km north of <unk>
task force haynes became operational at <num> <num> september <num>
southward in the <unk> area <unk> placed brigadier general joseph s
bradley assistant division commander in charge of the <num> infantry regiment the <num> engineer combat battalion most of the <num> tank battalion and other miscellaneous units of the division
this southern grouping was known as task force bradley
all three regiments of the <unk> <num> division @-@ the <num> <num> and <num> in line from north to south @-@ crossed during the night to the east side of the naktong river into the <num> regiment sector
the <unk> <num> division concentrated in the <unk> @-@ ni area west of the river had in effect attacked straight east across the river and was trying to seize the two avenues of advance into <unk> above and below lake u @-@ p 'o
on august <num> <year> lake u @-@ p 'o was a large body of water although in most places very shallow
at dawn september <num> <unk> at <num> division headquarters in <unk> @-@ ni <num> miles <num> km east of <unk> on the <unk> road felt his division was in the midst of a crisis
the massive north korean attack had made deep penetrations everywhere in the division sector except in the north in the zone of the <num> infantry
the <unk> <num> division had effected major crossings of the naktong at two principal points against the us <num> infantry the <unk> <num> division in the meantime had made three major crossings against the us <num> infantry and the <unk> <num> division had begun crossing more troops in the hill <num> area near <unk> 'ung in the us <num> infantry sector
at <num> <num> <unk> telephoned eighth army headquarters and reported the heaviest and deepest north korean penetrations were in the <num> infantry sector
liaison planes rose from the division strip every hour to observe the north korean progress and to locate us <num> infantry division front @-@ line units
communication from division and regimental headquarters to nearly all the forward units was broken
beginning at <num> <num> and continuing throughout the rest of the day the light aviation section of the division artillery located front @-@ line units cut off by the north koreans and made fourteen <unk> of ammunition food water and medical supplies
as information slowly built up at division headquarters it became apparent that the north koreans had punched a hole <num> miles <num>
<num> km wide and <num> miles <num> km deep in the middle of the division line and made less severe penetrations elsewhere
the front @-@ line battalions of the us <num> and <num> regiments were in various states of <unk> and some companies had virtually disappeared
<unk> hoped he could organize a defense along the <unk> @-@ <unk> road east of the naktong river and prevent north korean access to the passes eastward leading to <unk> and ch <unk>
he wanted the air force to isolate the battlefield and prevent further north korean reinforcements and supplies from moving across the river in support of the north korean spearhead units
the far east command requested the us navy to join in the air effort and the us seventh fleet turned back from its strikes in the inch <unk> @-@ seoul area and sped southward at full steam toward the southern battle front
walker came to the us <num> division front at <num> <num> and ordered the division to hold at all costs
he had already ordered ground reinforcements to the <unk> area
during the morning of <num> september walker weighed the news coming in from his southern front <unk> in a decision as to which part of the front most needed his pusan perimeter reserves
since midnight the <unk> i corps had broken his pusan perimeter in two places @-@ the <unk> <num> and <num> divisions in the us <num> division sector and the <unk> <num> division and <unk> <num> division in the us <num> division sector below the junction of the nam and naktong rivers
in the us <num> division sector north korean troops were at the edge of <unk> the gateway to the corridor leading <num> miles <num> km eastward to <unk> and the main pusan @-@ <unk> railroad and highway
eighth army had in reserve three understrength infantry regiments and the <num> @-@ battalion british <num> infantry brigade which was not yet completely equipped and ready to be placed in line the 1st provisional marine brigade at <unk> <num> miles <num>
<num> km northeast of <unk> preparing for movement to the port of pusan the us <num> infantry regiment of the <num> division which had arrived at <unk> only the night before at <num> <num> to relieve the <num> regimental combat team which was then to join the <num> division in the taegu area and the us <num> infantry regiment of the us <num> infantry division then with that division 's headquarters at <unk> southeast of taegu
walker alerted both the <num> division headquarters together with its <num> regiment and the 1st provisional marine brigade to move at a moment 's notice the <num> division either to the <num> or <num> division fronts and the marines to an unannounced destination
as the morning passed general walker decided that the situation was most critical in the naktong bulge area of the us <num> division sector
there the north koreans threatened <unk> and with it the entire eighth army position
at <num> <num> walker ordered us marine corps brigadier general edward a
craig commanding the 1st provisional marine brigade to prepare the marines to move at once
the marines made ready to depart for the naktong bulge at <num> <num>
the north koreans at one place had crossed at the <unk> ferry captured <unk> and scattered a company <num> infantry at its positions from <unk> northward
a company withdrew to positions on the ridge line back of the river
from there at daylight the men could see north korean soldiers on many of the ridges surrounding them most of them moving east
after several hours <num> platoon of a company sent a patrol down the hill to <unk> to obtain supplies abandoned there during the night returning later with much needed water rations and ammunition
later in the morning north korean barges crossed the naktong below a company
the company sent a squad with a light machine gun to the southern tip of the ridge overlooking <unk> to take these troops under fire
when the squad reached the tip of the ridge they saw that a north korean force occupied houses at its base
the company hit these houses with artillery
the north koreans broke from the houses running for the river
at this the light machine gun at the tip of the ridge took them under fire as did another across the naktong to the south in the us <num> infantry division sector
proximity <unk> artillery fire decimated this group
combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated <num> casualties on this north korean force
in the afternoon us aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company only part of it was recovered
the 1st battalion ordered a company to withdraw the company that night
during the withdraw however a company ran into a sizable north korean force and had scattered in the ensuing fight
most of the company including its commander were killed at close range
in this desperate action private first class luther h
story a weapons squad leader fought so <unk> that he was awarded the medal of honor
badly wounded story refused to be a burden to those who might escape and when last seen was still engaging north korean at close range
of those in the company approximately ten men escaped to friendly lines
the next morning under heavy fog the group made its way by compass toward <unk>
from a hill at <num> <num> after the fog had lifted the men looked down on the battle of <unk> which was then in progress
that afternoon <num> survivors of the company merged into the lines of the <num> tank battalion near <unk>
stragglers from this position continued to stream in the next few days as well
<num> km north of where a company had been destroyed on the southern end of the line
the perimeter position taken by the men of d and h companies <num> infantry who had started up the hill before the north koreans struck was on a southern <unk> of hill <num> <num>
<num> miles <num>
<num> km south of b company 's higher position
in addition to the d and h company men there were a few from the heavy mortar platoon and one or two from b company
altogether <num> to <num> men were in the group
the group had an scr @-@ <num> radio a heavy machine gun two light machine gun a <num> browning automatic rifle about <num> <num> <unk> rifles and about <num> carbines or pistols
<unk> assumed command of the group
during the night <unk> established radio communication with the 1st battalion <num> infantry
when daylight came <unk> and his group saw that they were surrounded by north koreans
one force occupied the higher <unk> half a mile above them formerly held by b company
below them north koreans continued crossing the river and moving supplies forward to their combat units some of them already several miles eastward
the north koreans quickly discovered task force <unk> group
they first attacked it at <num> <num> that afternoon and were repulsed
that night an estimated company attacked three times pressing the fight to close quarters but failed each time to penetrate the tight us perimeter
daylight of the second day disclosed many north korean dead on the steep slopes outside the perimeter
in the afternoon of september <num> <unk> <unk> 1st battalion for an <unk> of supplies
a us plane attempted the drop but the perimeter was so small and the slopes so steep that virtually all the supplies went into north korean hands
the men in the perimeter did however recover from a drop made later at <num> <num> some supplies and ammunition
private first class joseph r
<unk> of h company left the perimeter to gather weapons ammunition and grenades from the north korean dead
on several occasions he was attacked and on one such occasion a north korean soldier suddenly attacked <unk> who killed the north korean in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat
that same afternoon the north koreans sent an american prisoner up the hill to <unk> with the message you have one hour to surrender or be blown to pieces
failing in frontal infantry attack to reduce the little defending force the north koreans now meant to take it under mortar fire
only <num> minutes later north korean antitank fire came in on the <unk> and two machine guns from positions northward and higher on the slope of hill <num> swept the perimeter
soon mortars emplaced on a neighboring high finger ridge eastward registered on <unk> 's perimeter and continued firing until dark
the machine gun fire forced every man to stay in his <unk>
the lifting of the mortar fire after dark was the signal for renewed north korean infantry attacks all of which were repulsed
but the number of killed and wounded within the perimeter was growing and supplies were diminishing
there were no medical supplies except those carried by one aid man
the third day september <num> the situation worsened
the weather was hot and ammunition food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted
since the previous afternoon north korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter
survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed
two north korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself
dead and dying us troops were in almost every <unk>
mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other us units
artillery fire and air strikes requested by <unk> never came
some north koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and threw grenades into it
six times <unk> leaped from his <unk> to escape grenades thrown into it
in this close action <unk> was killed
most of the <unk> of the perimeter received one or more direct mortar hits in the course of the continuing mortar fire
one of these killed <unk> on september <num>
the command passed now to first lieutenant raymond j
<unk> of d company senior surviving officer
at daylight on the morning of <num> september only two officers and approximately half the men who had assembled on the hill were alive
as the day passed with ammunition down to about one clip per man and only a few grenades left and no help in sight <unk> decided to abandon the position that night
when it got dark the survivors would split into small groups and try to get back to friendly lines
that evening after dark the north koreans launched another weak attack against the position
at <num> <num> <unk> and caldwell and <num> enlisted men slipped off the hill in groups of four
master sergeant travis e
watkins still alive in his paralyzed condition refused efforts of evacuation saying that he did not want to be a burden to those who had a chance to get away
he asked only that his <unk> be loaded and placed on his chest with the muzzle under his chin
like <unk> he would also win the medal of honor for his actions
of the <num> men who came off the hill the night of september <num> <num> escaped to friendly lines many of them following the naktong downstream hiding by day and traveling by night until they reached the lines of the us <num> infantry division
members of task force <unk> who escaped from hill <num> brought back considerable intelligence information of north korean activity in the vicinity of the <unk> ferry crossing site
at the ferry site the north koreans had put in an underwater bridge
a short distance downstream each night they placed a pontoon bridge across the river and took it up before dawn the next morning
carrying parties of <num> civilians guarded by four north korean soldiers crossed the river continuously at night an estimated total of <num> @-@ <num> @,@ <num> carriers being used at this crossing site
its 1st battalion had been driven from the river positions and isolated <num> miles <num>
<num> km westward
approximately <num> north koreans now overran the regimental command post compelling freeman to withdraw it about <num> yards <num> m
there <num> miles <num>
<num> km northwest of <unk> the us <num> infantry headquarters and headquarters company miscellaneous regimental units and regimental staff officers checked the north koreans in a <num> @-@ hour fight
the north koreans advanced to <unk> itself during the afternoon of september <num> and rok national police withdrew from the town
north koreans were in <unk> that evening
with his communications broken southward to the <num> infantry division headquarters and the <num> infantry haynes during the day decided to send a tank patrol down the <unk> road in an effort to re @-@ establish communication
c company <num> tank battalion led its tanks southward
they had to fight their way down the road through several roadblocks
of the three tanks that started only the lead tank got through to <unk>
there it delivered an overlay of task force haynes positions to bradley
still farther northward in the zone of the us <num> infantry the north koreans were also active
after the north korean breakthrough during the night of august <num> <unk> had ordered the <num> battalion <num> infantry to move south and help the <num> infantry establish a defensive position west of <unk>
in attempting to do this the battalion found north korean troops already on the ridges along the road
they had penetrated to hill <num> overlooking the <num> infantry command post
this hill and hill <num> dominated the rear areas of the regiment
at <num> <num> september <num> <num> north koreans launched an attack from hill <num> against the <num> regiment command post
the regimental commander organized a defensive perimeter and requested a bombing strike which was denied him because the enemy target and his defense perimeter were too close to each other
but the air force did deliver rocket and strafing strikes
this fight continued until september <num>
on that day f company captured hill <num> killing <num> north koreans
from the crest he and his men watched as many more north koreans ran into a village below them
directed artillery fire destroyed the village
among the abandoned north korean materiel on the hill <unk> 's men found twenty @-@ five american bars and submachine guns a large american radio thirty boxes of unopened american fragmentation and concussion grenades and some american rations
<num> km west of the nearest friendly units
on september <num> the regiment ordered it to withdraw to the <unk> area
at <num> <num> a tank @-@ infantry patrol was sent down the road but it reported that an estimated north korean battalion held the mountain pass just eastward of the battalion 's defense perimeter
upon receiving this report the battalion commander requested permission by radio to remain in his present position and try to obstruct the movement of north korean reinforcements and supplies
that evening freeman approved this request and 1st battalion spent three days in the isolated positions
during this time c @-@ <num> skytrain planes supplied the battalion by <unk>
on the morning of september <num> <num> battalion <num> infantry moved in an attack westward from the <num> regiment command post near <unk> @-@ ni to open the road to the 1st battalion
on the second day of the fighting at the pass the relief force broke through the roadblock with the help of air strikes and artillery and tank fire
the advanced elements of the battalion joined 1st battalion at <num> <num> september <num>
that evening north koreans strongly attacked the <num> battalion <num> infantry on hill <num> north of the road and opposite 1st battalion driving one company from its position
on september <num> haynes changed the boundary between the <num> and <num> infantry regiments giving the northern part of the <num> 's sector to the <num> infantry thus releasing 1st battalion for movement southward to help the <num> battalion defend the southern approach to <unk>
the 1st battalion <num> infantry about <num> @,@ <num> men strong when the attack began was now down to a strength of approximately <num> men
the <num> infantry now made plans to concentrate all its troops on the position held by its <num> battalion on the <unk> @-@ ni @-@ <unk> road
the 1st battalion moved there and took a place on the left flank of the <num> battalion
at the same time the regimental command post moved to the rear of this position
in this regimental perimeter the <num> infantry fought a series of hard battles
simultaneously it had to send combat patrols to its rear to clear infiltrating north koreans from <unk> and from its supply road
the <num> regiment had been left at inch <unk> but division commander major general pak <unk> sam felt the chances of capturing <unk> were strong
on the morning of september <num> with only the shattered remnants of e company at hand the us <num> infantry regiment us <num> infantry division had virtually no troops to defend <unk>
<unk> in this emergency attached the <num> engineer combat battalion to the regiment
the us <num> tank battalion and the <num> division reconnaissance company also were assigned positions close to <unk>
the regimental commander planned to place the engineers on the chain of low hills that arched around <unk> on the northwest
a company <num> engineer combat battalion moved to the south side of the <unk> @-@ naktong river road d company of the <num> engineer battalion was on the north side of the road
approximately <num> miles <num>
<num> km west of <unk> an estimated <num> north korean troops engaged a company in a fire fight
<num> gun motor carriages of the <num> aaa battalion supported the engineers in this action which lasted several hours
meanwhile with the approval of general bradley d company moved to the hill immediately south of and overlooking <unk>
a platoon of infantry went into position behind it
a company was now ordered to fall back to the southeast edge of <unk> on the left flank of d company
there a company went into position along the road on its left was c company of the engineer battalion and beyond c company was the <num> division reconnaissance company
the hill occupied by d company was in reality the western tip of a large mountain mass that lay southeast of the town
the road to <unk> came south out of <unk> bent around the western tip of this mountain and then ran eastward along its southern base
in its position d company not only commanded the town but also its exit the road to <unk>
north koreans had also approached <unk> from the south
the us <num> division reconnaissance company and tanks of the <num> tank battalion opposed them in a sharp fight
in this action sergeant first class charles w
turner of the reconnaissance company particularly distinguished himself
he mounted a tank operated its exposed turret machine gun and directed tank fire which reportedly destroyed seven north korean machine guns
turner and this tank came under heavy north korean fire which shot away the tank 's periscope and antennae and scored more than <num> hits on it
turner although wounded remained on the tank until he was killed
that night north korean soldiers crossed the low ground around <unk> and entered the town from the south
at <num> <num> september <num> while the north koreans were attempting to destroy the engineer troops at the southern edge of <unk> and clear the road to <unk> walker spoke by telephone with major general doyle o
<unk> deputy chief of staff far east command in tokyo
he described the situation around the perimeter and said the most serious threat was along the boundary between the us <num> and us <num> infantry divisions
he described the location of his reserve forces and his plans for using them
he said he had started the 1st provisional marine brigade toward <unk> but had not yet released them for commitment there and he wanted to be sure that general of the army douglas macarthur approved his use of them since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the far east command
walker said he did not think he could restore the <num> division lines without using them
<unk> replied that macarthur had the day before approved the use of the us marines if and when walker considered it necessary
a few hours after this conversation walker at <num> <num> attached the 1st provisional marine brigade to the us <num> division and ordered a co @-@ ordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the marines with the mission of destroying the north koreans east of the naktong river in the <num> division sector and of restoring the river line
the marines were to be released from <num> division control as soon as this mission was accomplished
a decision was reached that the marines would attack west at <num> <num> on september <num> astride the <unk> @-@ naktong river road the <num> infantry b company of the <num> tank battalion and d battery of the <unk> aaa battalion would attack northwest above the marines and attempt to re @-@ establish contact with the us <num> infantry the <num> engineer combat battalion remnants of the 1st battalion <num> infantry and elements of the <num> tank battalion would attack on the left flank or south of the marines to reestablish contact with the <num> division
eighth army now ordered the us <num> infantry division headquarters and the us <num> infantry regiment to move to the susan @-@ ni area <num> miles <num> km south of <unk> and <num> miles <num> km east of the confluence of the nam river and the naktong river
there it was to prepare to enter the battle in either the <num> or <num> division zone
the american counteroffensive of september <num> – <num> west of <unk> according to prisoner statements resulted in one of the bloodiest <unk> of the war for a north korean division
even though remnants of the <unk> <num> division supported by the low strength <unk> <num> division still held <unk> @-@ ni ridge cloverleaf hill and the intervening ground back to the naktong on september <num> the division 's offensive strength had been spent at the end of the american counterattack
the <unk> <num> and <num> divisions were not able to resume the offensive
this attack launched at <num> <num> and heavily supported with artillery penetrated f company
it was apparent that unless f company 's position could be restored the entire regimental front would collapse
when all its officers became casualties first lieutenant ralph r
robinson adjutant of the <num> battalion assumed command of the company
with north koreans rapidly infiltrating his company 's position and gaining its rear robinson in the darkness made his way through them <num> yards <num> m to a company 's position
there he obtained that company 's reserve platoon and brought it back to f company
he accomplished the dangerous and difficult task of <unk> it into the gap in f company 's lines in darkness and heavy rain
the attack tapered off with the coming of daylight but that night it resumed
the north koreans struck repeatedly at the defense line
this time they continued the fighting into the daylight hours of <num> september
the air force then concentrated strong air support over the regimental perimeter to aid the ground troops
casualties came to the aid stations from the infantry companies in an almost steady stream during the morning
all available men from headquarters company and special units were formed into squads and put into the fight at the most critical points
at one time the regimental reserve was down to six men
when the attack finally ceased shortly after <num> <num> the <num> regiment had an estimated combat efficiency of only <num> percent
this heavy night and day battle cost the <unk> <num> division most of its remaining offensive strength
the medical officer of the <unk> <num> regiment <num> division captured a few days later said that the division evacuated about <num> men nightly to a hospital in <unk> @-@ ni and that in the first two weeks of september the <num> division lost <num> @,@ <num> killed and <num> @,@ <num> wounded in the fighting west of <unk>
even though its offensive strength was largely spent by september <num> the division continued to harass rear areas around <unk> with infiltrating groups as large as companies
patrols daily had to open the main supply road and clear the town
north korean and us troops remained locked in combat along the naktong river for several more days
the north koreans offensive capability was largely destroyed and the us troops resolved to hold their lines barring further attack
on september <num> the un discovered the north koreans had abandoned much of the pusan perimeter during the night and the un units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them
most of the north korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into north korea
the north koreans withdrew from the <unk> area first the night of september <num> – <num>
after the forces there the remainder of the north korean armies withdrew rapidly to the north
the us units rapidly pursued them north passing over the naktong river positions which were no longer of strategic importance
the <num> division had numbered <num> @,@ <num> men at the beginning of the offensive on september <num>
the <num> division numbered <num> @,@ <num>
only a few hundred from each division returned to north korea after the fight
the majority of the north korean troops had been killed captured or deserted
all of <unk> ii corps was in a similar state and the north korean army exhausted at pusan perimeter and cut off after inchon was on the brink of defeat
by this time the us <num> infantry division suffered <num> @,@ <num> killed <num> @,@ <num> wounded <num> captured and <num> missing during its time at pusan perimeter
this included about <num> casualties it suffered during the first battle of naktong bulge the previous month
american forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the north koreans from breaking the pusan perimeter
the division had numbered <num> @,@ <num> on september <num> but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties
the 1st provisional marine brigade suffered <num> killed and around <num> wounded during the battle of pusan perimeter most of which probably occurred at <unk>
of all the north korean attacks along the pusan perimeter the second battle of naktong bulge is seen by historians as the most serious threat
it was the battle in which the north koreans made the most substantial gains splitting the us <num> infantry division in half and briefly capturing <unk> where they were very close to breaching through to the us forces supply lines and threatening other divisions rear areas
however once again the fatal weakness of the north korean army had cost it victory after an impressive initial success — its communications and supply were not capable of exploiting a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack in the face of massive air armor and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points
by september <num> the north korean attacks in the area had been repulsed

due to the label 's contractual terms and the disappointing sales of the album the band found themselves unable to repay the cash advances given to them by <unk>
gomes is quoted as saying we had these romantic visions of the music industry and we thought it would be cool to be a punk band on a rap label
so we fulfilled that dream but it was also probably the worst thing that could have happened

the ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells
the first ironclad battleship gloire was launched by the french navy in november <year>
the british admiralty had been considering armored warships since <year> and prepared a draft design for an armored corvette in <year> in early <year> the royal navy started building two iron @-@ hulled armored frigates and by <year> had made the decision to move to an all @-@ armored battle fleet
after the first clashes of ironclads both with wooden ships and with one another took place in <year> during the american civil war it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the unarmored ship of the line as the most powerful warship afloat
this type of ship would come to be very successful in the american civil war
ironclads were designed for several roles including as high seas battleships coastal defense ships and long @-@ range cruisers
the rapid evolution of warship design in the late <num> century transformed the ironclad from a wooden @-@ hulled vessel that carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel @-@ built <unk> battleships and cruisers familiar in the <num> century
this change was pushed forward by the development of heavier naval guns the ironclads of the <num> carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea more sophisticated steam engines and advances in metallurgy which made steel shipbuilding possible
the quick pace of change meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were finished and that naval tactics were in a state of flux
many ironclads were built to make use of the ram or the torpedo which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat
there is no clear end to the ironclad period but towards the end of the <num> the term ironclad dropped out of use
new ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers
according to naval historian j
richard hill the ironclad had three chief characteristics a metal @-@ skinned hull steam propulsion and a main armament of guns capable of firing explosive shells
it is only when all three characteristics are present that a fighting ship can properly be called an ironclad
each of these developments was introduced separately in the decade before the first ironclads
the first major change to these types was the introduction of steam power for propulsion
while paddle steamer warships had been used from the <num> onwards steam propulsion only became suitable for major warships after the adoption of the screw propeller in the <num>
steam @-@ powered screw frigates were built in the mid @-@ <num> and at the end of the decade the french navy introduced steam power to its line of battle
the desire for change came from the ambition of napoleon iii to gain greater influence in europe which required a challenge to the british at sea
the first purpose @-@ built steam battleship was the <num> @-@ gun napoléon in <year>
napoléon was armed as a conventional ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line but her steam engines could give her a speed of <num> knots <num> km h regardless of the wind conditions a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement
the introduction of the steam ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line led to a building competition between france and britain
eight sister ships to napoléon were built in france over a period of ten years but the united kingdom soon managed to take the lead in production
altogether france built ten new wooden steam battleships and converted <num> from older ships of the line while the united kingdom built <num> and converted <num>
in the <num> and <num> warships began to mount increasingly heavy guns replacing <num> and <num> @-@ pounder guns with <num> @-@ pounders on sailing ships @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line and introducing <num> @-@ pounders on steamers
then the first shell guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the french <unk> henri @-@ joseph <unk> and by the <num> were part of the standard armament for naval powers including the french navy royal navy imperial russian navy and united states navy
it is often held that the power of explosive shells to smash wooden hulls as demonstrated by the russian destruction of an ottoman squadron at the battle of <unk> spelled the end of the wooden @-@ hulled warship
the more practical threat to wooden ships was from conventional cannon firing red @-@ hot shot which could lodge in the hull of a wooden ship and cause a fire or ammunition explosion
some navies even experimented with hollow shot filled with molten metal for extra incendiary power
there followed also from laird the first full @-@ blown warships with metal hulls the <year> steam frigates <unk> and <unk> for the mexican navy
but a thin iron skin while not being susceptible to fire or lethal <unk> like wood was not the same thing as providing iron armor calculated to stop enemy gunfire
following the demonstration of the power of explosive shells against wooden ships at the battle of <unk> and fearing that his own ships would be vulnerable to the <unk> guns of russian fortifications in the crimean war emperor napoleon iii ordered the development of light @-@ draft floating batteries equipped with heavy guns and protected by heavy armor
experiments made during the first half of <year> proved highly satisfactory and on <num> july <year> the french communicated to the british government that a solution had been found to make gun @-@ proof vessels and that plans would be communicated
after tests in september <year> the british admiralty agreed to build five armoured floating batteries on the french plans establishing the important thames and millwall iron works within the docks
the french floating batteries were deployed in <year> as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the crimean war
the role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications
the french used three of their ironclad batteries <unk> <unk> and <unk> in <year> against the defenses at the battle of <unk> on the black sea where they were effective against russian shore defences
they would later be used again during the italian war in the adriatic in <year>
the british floating batteries <unk> and meteor arrived too late to participate to the action at <unk>
the british planned to use theirs in the baltic sea against the well @-@ fortified naval base at kronstadt
the batteries have a claim to the title of the first ironclad warships but they were capable of only <num> knots <num> km h under their own power they operated under their own power at the battle of <unk> but had to be towed for long range transit
they were also arguably marginal to the work of the navy
the brief success of the floating ironclad batteries convinced france to begin work on armored warships for their battlefleet
the result was the first ocean @-@ going ironclad the gloire begun in <year> and launched in <year>
gloire 's wooden hull was modelled on that of a steam ship of the line reduced to one deck sheathed in iron plates <num>
<num> inches <num> mm thick
she was propelled by a steam engine driving a single screw propeller for a speed of <num> knots <num> km h
she was armed with thirty @-@ six <num>
<num> @-@ inch <num> mm rifled guns
france proceeded to construct <num> ironclad warships including two more sister ships to gloire and the only two @-@ decked broadside ironclads ever built <unk> and <unk>
the royal navy had not been keen to sacrifice its advantage in steam ships of the line but was determined that the first british ironclad would <unk> the french ships in every respect particularly speed
a fast ship would have the advantage of being able to choose a range of engagement which could make her <unk> to enemy fire
the british specification was more a large powerful frigate than a ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line
the requirement for speed meant a very long vessel which had to be built from iron
the result was the construction of two warrior @-@ class ironclads hms warrior and hms black prince
the ships had a successful design though there were necessarily compromises between sea @-@ keeping strategic range and armour protection their weapons were more effective than that of gloire and with the largest set of steam engines yet fitted to a ship they could steam at <num>
<num> knots <num>
<num> km h
yet the gloire and her sisters had full iron @-@ armour protection along the waterline and the battery itself
warrior and black prince but also the smaller defence and resistance were obliged to concentrate their armour in a central citadel or armoured box leaving many main deck guns and the fore and aft sections of the vessel unprotected
the use of iron in the construction of warrior also came with some drawbacks iron hulls required more regular and intensive repairs than wooden hulls and iron was more susceptible to fouling by marine life
by <year> navies across europe had adopted ironclads
britain and france each had sixteen either completed or under construction though the british vessels were larger
austria italy russia and spain were also building ironclads
however the first battles using the new ironclad ships involved neither britain nor france and involved ships markedly different from the broadside @-@ firing masted designs of gloire and warrior
the use of ironclads by both sides in the american civil war and the clash of the italian and austrian fleets at the battle of <unk> had an important influence on the development of ironclad design

the u
s
navy at the time the war broke out had no ironclads its most powerful ships being six steam @-@ powered <unk> frigates
since the bulk of the navy remained loyal to the union the confederacy sought to gain advantage in the naval conflict by acquiring modern armored ships
in may <year> the confederate congress voted that <num> million be appropriated for the purchase of ironclads from overseas and in july and august <year> the confederacy started work on construction and converting wooden ships
on <num> october <year> the css <unk> became the first ironclad to enter combat when she fought union warships on the mississippi during the battle of the head of passes
she had been converted from a commercial vessel in new orleans for river and coastal fighting
in february <year> the larger css virginia joined the confederate navy having been rebuilt at norfolk
constructed on the hull of uss <unk> virginia originally was a conventional warship made of wood but she was converted into an iron @-@ covered casemate ironclad gunship when she entered the confederate navy
by this time the union had completed seven ironclad gunboats of the city class and was about to complete the uss monitor an innovative design proposed by the swedish inventor john ericsson
the union was also building a large armored frigate the uss new <unk> and the smaller uss <unk>
the first battle between ironclads happened on <num> march <year> as the armored monitor was deployed to protect the union 's wooden fleet from the ironclad ram virginia and other confederate warships
in this engagement the second day of the battle of hampton roads the two ironclads repeatedly tried to ram one another while shells bounced off their armor
the battle attracted attention worldwide making it clear that the wooden warship was now out of date with the ironclads destroying them easily
the civil war saw more ironclads built by both sides and they played an increasing role in the naval war alongside the unarmored warships commerce raiders and blockade runners
the union built a large fleet of fifty monitors modeled on their namesake
the confederacy built ships designed as smaller versions of the virginia many of which saw action but their attempts to buy ironclads overseas were frustrated as european nations confiscated ships being built for the confederacy — especially in russia the only country to openly support the union through the war
only css stonewall was completed and she arrived in american waters just in time for the end of the war
through the remainder of the war ironclads saw action in the union 's attacks on confederate ports
seven union monitors including uss <unk> as well as two other ironclads the ironclad frigate new <unk> and a light @-@ draft uss <unk> participated in the failed attack on charleston one was sunk
two small ironclads css palmetto state and css <unk> participated in the defence of the harbor
for the later attack at mobile bay the union assembled four monitors as well as <num> wooden ships facing the css tennessee the confederacy 's most powerful ironclad and the gunboats css morgan css gaines css selma
on the western front the union built a formidable force of river ironclads beginning with several converted riverboats and then contracting engineer james <unk> of st
louis missouri to build the city @-@ class ironclads
these excellent ships were built with twin engines and a central paddle wheel all protected by an armored <unk>
they had a shallow draft allowing them to journey up smaller tributaries and were very well suited for river operations
<unk> also produced monitors for use on the rivers the first two of which differed from the ocean @-@ going monitors in that they contained a paddle wheel the uss <unk> and uss osage
arguably <unk> vessels were some of the better ironclads of the western flotilla but there were a number of other vessels that served valiantly with the fleet
all were of varying design some more successful than others and some were similar to standard riverboats but with armored side @-@ mounted paddle wheels
all were armed with various smoothbore and some rifled guns
if nothing else the experience of the american civil war and its wild variety of competing ironclad designs some more successful or disastrous than others confirmed the emerging trade @-@ off or compromises required in applying the latest technological advances in iron armour manufacture ship construction and gun design — to name a few — also going on in europe
there was no such thing as a perfect ironclad which could be invincible in every possible encounter ship duels standing up to forts brown blue @-@ water operations
the union ironclads played an important role in the mississippi and tributaries by providing tremendous fire upon confederate forts installations and vessels with relative impunity to enemy fire
they were not as heavily armored as the ocean @-@ going monitors of the union but they were adequate for their intended use
more western flotilla union ironclads were sunk by torpedoes mines than by enemy fire and the most damaging fire for the union ironclads was from shore installations not confederate vessels
waged between the austrian and italian navies the battle pitted combined fleets of wooden frigates and corvettes and ironclad warships on both sides in the largest naval battle between the battles of <unk> and <unk>
the italian fleet consisted of <num> ironclads and a similar number of wooden warships escorting transports which carried troops intending to land on the adriatic island of <unk>
among the italian ironclads were seven broadside ironclad frigates four smaller ironclads and the newly built <unk> — a double @-@ <unk> ram
opposing them the austrian navy had seven ironclad frigates
the austrians believed their ships to have less effective guns than their enemy so decided to engage the italians at close range and ram them
the austrian fleet formed into an <unk> formation with the ironclads in the first line charging at the italian ironclad squadron
in the <unk> which followed both sides were frustrated by the lack of damage inflicted by guns and by the difficulty of <unk> — nonetheless the effective <unk> attack being made by the austrian flagship against the italian attracted great attention in following years
the superior italian fleet lost its two ironclads re d 'italia and palestro while the austrian <unk> screw two @-@ decker sms kaiser remarkably survived close actions with four italian ironclads
the battle ensured the popularity of the ram as a weapon in european ironclads for many years and the victory won by austria established it as the predominant naval power in the adriatic
the battles of the american civil war and at <unk> were very influential on the designs and tactics of the ironclad fleets that followed
in particular it taught a generation of naval officers the misleading lesson that <unk> was the best way to sink enemy ironclads
to penetrate armor increasingly heavy guns were mounted on ships nevertheless the view that <unk> was the only way to sink an ironclad became widespread
the increasing size and weight of guns also meant a movement away from the ships mounting many guns broadside in the manner of a ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line towards a handful of guns in turrets for all @-@ round fire
with steam power freeing ships from the wind and armor making them <unk> to shellfire the ram seemed to offer the opportunity to strike a decisive blow
the scant damage inflicted by the guns of monitor and virginia at battle of hampton roads and the spectacular but lucky success of the austrian flagship sms erzherzog ferdinand max sinking the italian re d 'italia at <unk> gave strength to the <unk> craze
from the early <num> to early <num> most british naval officers thought that guns were about to be replaced as the main naval armament by the ram
those who noted the tiny number of ships that had actually been sunk by <unk> struggled to be heard
the revival of <unk> had a significant effect on naval tactics
since the <num> century the predominant tactic of naval warfare had been the line of battle where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns
this tactic was totally unsuited to <unk> and the ram threw fleet tactics into disarray
the question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle and if it had been combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water
the ram finally fell out of favour in the <num> as the same effect could be achieved with a torpedo with less vulnerability to quick @-@ firing guns
throughout the ironclad era navies also <unk> with the <unk> of rifled versus smoothbore guns and breech @-@ loading versus muzzle @-@ loading
hms warrior carried a mixture of <num> @-@ pounder <num> inch <num> mm breech @-@ loading rifles and more traditional <num> @-@ pounder smoothbore guns
warrior highlighted the challenges of picking the right armament the breech @-@ <unk> she carried designed by sir william armstrong were intended to be the next generation of heavy armament for the royal navy but were shortly withdrawn from service
breech @-@ loading guns seemed to offer important advantages
a breech @-@ loader could be reloaded without moving the gun a lengthy process particularly if the gun then needed to be re @-@ aimed
the warrior 's armstrong guns also had the virtue of being lighter than an equivalent smoothbore and because of their rifling more accurate
nonetheless the design was rejected because of problems which plagued breech @-@ <unk> for decades
the weakness of the breech @-@ loader was the obvious problem of sealing the breech
all guns are powered by the explosive conversion of gunpowder into gas
this explosion <unk> the shot or shell out of the front of the gun but also <unk> great stresses on the gun @-@ barrel
if the breech — which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun — is not entirely secure then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break
this in turn reduces the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew
the warrior 's armstrong guns suffered from both problems the shells were unable to penetrate the <num>
<num> in <num> mm armor of gloire while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing
similar problems were experienced with the breech @-@ loading guns which became standard in the french and german navies
these problems influenced the british to equip ships with muzzle @-@ loading weapons of increasing power until the <num>
after a brief introduction of <num> @-@ pounder or <num>
<num> @-@ inch <num> mm smoothbore somerset gun which weighed <num>
<num> tons <num>
<num> t the admiralty introduced <num> @-@ inch <num> mm rifled guns weighing <num> tons
these were followed by a series of increasingly mammoth weapons — guns weighing <num> <num> <num> <num> and finally <num> tons with calibre increasing from <num> @-@ inch <num> mm to <num> @-@ inch <num> mm
the decision to retain muzzle @-@ <unk> until the <num> has been criticised by historians
however at least until the late <num> the british muzzle @-@ <unk> had superior performance in terms of both range and rate of fire than the french and prussian breech @-@ <unk> which suffered from the same problems as had the first armstrong guns
from <year> onwards the balance between <unk> and muzzle @-@ loading changed
captain de <unk> invented a method of reliably sealing a breech adopted by the french in <year>
just as <unk> the growing size of naval guns made muzzle @-@ loading much more complicated
with guns of such size there was no prospect of hauling in the gun for re @-@ loading or even re @-@ loading by hand and complicated hydraulic systems were required for re @-@ loading the gun outside the turret without exposing the crew to enemy fire
in <year> the <num> @-@ ton <num> @-@ inch <num> mm guns of hms inflexible fired only once every <num> minutes while bombarding alexandria during the <unk> revolt
the <num> @-@ ton <num> mm <num>
<num> inch guns of <unk> <unk> could each fire a round every <num> minutes
in the royal navy the switch to breech @-@ <unk> was finally made in <year> as well as the significant advantages in terms of performance opinion was swayed by an explosion on board hms thunderer caused by a gun being double @-@ loaded a problem which could only happen with a muzzle @-@ loading gun
the calibre and weight of guns could only increase so far
the larger the gun the slower it would be to load the greater the stresses on the ship 's hull and the less the stability of the ship
the size of the gun peaked in the <num> with some of the heaviest calibres of gun ever used at sea
hms <unk> carried two <num>
<num> @-@ inch <num> mm breech @-@ loading guns each weighing <num> tons — no british battleship would ever carry guns as large
the italian <num> mm <num>
<num> inch guns would be larger than any gun fitted to a battleship until the <num>
<num> @-@ inch <num> mm armament of the japanese yamato class of world war ii
one consideration which became more acute was that even from the original armstrong models following the crimean war range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy especially at sea where the slightest roll or pitch of the vessel as floating weapons @-@ platform could <unk> the advantage of rifling
american ordnance experts accordingly preferred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could at least skip along the surface of the water
actual effective combat ranges they had learned during the civil war were comparable to those in the age of sail — though a vessel could now be smashed to pieces in only a few rounds
smoke and the general chaos of battle only added to the problem
as a result many naval engagements in the age of the ironclad were still fought at ranges within easy eyesight of their targets and well below the maximum reach of their ships guns
another method of increasing firepower was to vary the projectile fired or the nature of the propellant
early ironclads used black powder which expanded rapidly after combustion this meant cannons had relatively short barrels to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell
the sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress
one important step was to press the powder into pellets allowing a slower more controlled explosion and a longer barrel
a further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which <unk> more slowly again
it also put less stress on the insides of the barrel allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter <unk>
the development of smokeless powder based on <unk> or <unk> by the french inventor paul <unk> in <year> was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels
the guns of the pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of the <num> tended to be smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the <num> most often <num> in <num> mm but progressively grew in length of barrel making use of improved <unk> to gain greater muzzle velocity
the nature of the projectiles also changed during the ironclad period
initially the best armor @-@ piercing projectile was a solid cast @-@ iron shot
later shot of chilled iron a harder iron alloy gave better armor @-@ piercing qualities
eventually the armor @-@ piercing shell was developed
both gloire and hms warrior were examples of this type
because their armor was so heavy they could only carry a single row of guns along the main deck on each side rather than a row on each deck
a significant number of broadside ironclads were built in the <num> principally in britain and france but in smaller numbers by other powers including italy austria russia and the united states
the advantages of mounting guns on both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than one adversary at a time and the rigging did not impede the field of fire
broadside armament also had disadvantages which became more serious as ironclad technology developed
heavier guns to penetrate ever @-@ thicker armor meant that fewer guns could be carried
furthermore the adoption of <unk> as an important tactic meant the need for ahead and all @-@ round fire
these problems led to broadside designs being superseded by designs that gave greater all @-@ round fire which included central @-@ battery turret and barbette designs
in one design the guns were placed in an armoured casemate amidships this arrangement was called the box @-@ battery or centre @-@ battery
in the other the guns could be placed on a rotating platform to give them a broad field of fire when fully armored this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or unarmored a barbette
the centre @-@ battery was the simpler and during the <num> and <num> the more popular method
concentrating guns amidships meant the ship could be shorter and <unk> than a broadside type
the first full @-@ scale centre @-@ battery ship was hms bellerophon of <year> the french laid down centre @-@ battery ironclads in <year> which were not completed until <year>
centre @-@ battery ships often but not always had a recessed <unk> enabling some of their guns to fire directly ahead
the turret was first used in naval combat on the uss monitor in <year> with a type of turret designed by the swedish engineer john ericsson
a competing turret design was proposed by the british inventor <unk> coles with a prototype of this installed on hms trusty in <year> for testing and evaluation purposes
ericsson 's turret turned on a central spindle and coles 's turned on a ring of bearings
turrets offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns but there were significant problems with their use in the <num>
the fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging so they were unsuited to use on the earlier ocean @-@ going ironclads
the second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy
ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret guns and armour protection by deliberately designing a ship with very low <unk>
the weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armour
low <unk> however also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage — and therefore range of the vessel
in many respects the <unk> low @-@ <unk> monitor and the broadside <unk> hms warrior represented two opposite extremes in what an ironclad was all about
the most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes or <unk> this circle was designed by captain <unk> phipps coles hms captain a dangerously low <unk> turret ship which nevertheless carried a full rig of sail and which subsequently capsized not long after her launch in <year>
her half @-@ sister hms monarch was restricted to firing from her turrets only on the port and starboard beams
the third royal navy ship to combine turrets and masts was hms inflexible of <year> which carried two turrets on either side of the centre @-@ line allowing both to fire fore aft and broadside
a lighter alternative to the turret particularly popular with the french navy was the barbette
these were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a turntable
the crew was sheltered from direct fire but vulnerable to plunging fire for instance from shore emplacements
the barbette was lighter than the turret needing less machinery and no roof armor — though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top @-@ weight of their ships
the barbette became widely adopted in the <num> and with the addition of an armored gun @-@ house transformed into the turrets of the pre @-@ dreadnought battleships
the first torpedoes were static mines used extensively in the american civil war
that conflict also saw the development of the spar torpedo an explosive charge pushed against the hull of a warship by a small boat
for the first time a large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller one — and given the relative inefficiency of shellfire against ironclads the threat from the spar torpedo was taken seriously
the u
s
navy converted four of its monitors to become <unk> armored spar @-@ torpedo vessels while under construction in <year> – <num> but these vessels never saw action
another proposal the towed or harvey torpedo involved an explosive on a line or outrigger either to deter a ship from <unk> or to make a torpedo attack by a boat less suicidal
a more practical and influential weapon was the self @-@ propelled or whitehead torpedo
invented in <year> and deployed in the <num> the whitehead torpedo formed part of the armament of ironclads of the <num> like hms inflexible and the italian <unk> <unk> and enrico <unk>
the ironclad 's vulnerability to the torpedo was a key part of the critique of armored warships made by the <unk> <unk> school of naval thought it appeared that any ship armored enough to prevent destruction by gunfire would be slow enough to be easily caught by torpedo
in practice however the <unk> <unk> was only briefly influential and the torpedo formed part of the confusing mixture of weapons possessed by ironclads
ironclads were still being built with wooden hulls into the <num>
however unarmored iron had many military disadvantages and offered technical problems which kept wooden hulls in use for many years particularly for long @-@ range cruising warships
iron ships had first been proposed for military use in the <num>
in the <num> and <num> france britain and the united states had all experimented with iron @-@ hulled but unarmored gunboats and frigates
however the iron @-@ hulled frigate was abandoned by the end of the <num> because iron hulls were more vulnerable to solid shot iron was more brittle than wood and iron frames more likely to fall out of shape than wood
the <unk> of unarmored iron for warship hulls meant that iron was only adopted as a building material for battleships when protected by armor
however iron gave the naval architect many advantages
iron allowed larger ships and more flexible design for instance the use of watertight bulkheads on the lower decks
warrior built of iron was longer and faster than the wooden @-@ hulled gloire
iron could be produced to order and used immediately in contrast to the need to give wood a long period of seasoning
and given the large quantities of wood required to build a steam warship and the falling cost of iron iron hulls were increasingly cost @-@ effective
the main reason for the french use of wooden hulls for the ironclad fleet built in the <num> was that the french iron industry could not supply enough and the main reason why britain built its handful of wooden @-@ hulled ironclads was to make best use of hulls already started and wood already bought
wooden hulls continued to be used for long @-@ range and smaller ironclads because iron nevertheless had a significant disadvantage
iron hulls suffered quick fouling by marine life slowing the ships down — <unk> for a european battlefleet close to dry docks but a difficulty for long @-@ range ships
the only solution was to sheath the iron hull first in wood and then in copper a laborious and expensive process which made wooden construction remain attractive
iron and wood were to some extent interchangeable the japanese <unk> and <unk> ordered in <year> were sister @-@ ships but one was built of iron and the other of composite construction
after <year> steel started to be introduced as a material for construction
compared to iron steel allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight
the french navy led the way with the use of steel in its fleet starting with the <unk> laid down in <year> and launched in <year>
<unk> nonetheless had wrought iron armor plate and part of her exterior hull was iron rather than steel
even though britain led the world in steel production the royal navy was slow to adopt steel warships
the <unk> process for steel manufacture produced too many imperfections for large @-@ scale use on ships
french manufacturers used the siemens @-@ martin process to produce adequate steel but british technology lagged behind
the first all @-@ steel warships built by the royal navy were the dispatch vessels iris and mercury laid down in <year> and <year>
hms warrior was protected by <num>
<num> in <num> mm of wrought iron backed by <num> in <num> mm of teak the strongest shipbuilding wood
the wood played two roles preventing <unk> and also preventing the shock of a hit damaging the structure of the ship
later wood and iron were combined in sandwich armor for instance in hms inflexible
steel was also an obvious material for armor
it was tested in the <num> but the steel of the time was too brittle and disintegrated when struck by shells
steel became practical to use when a way was found to fuse steel onto wrought iron plates giving a form of compound armor
this compound armor was used by the british in ships built from the late <num> first for turret armor starting with hms inflexible and then for all armor starting with hms colossus of <year>
the french and german navies adopted the innovation almost immediately with licenses being given for the use of the wilson system of producing fused armor
the first ironclads to have all @-@ steel armor were the italian <unk> <unk> and enrico <unk>
though the ships were laid down in <year> their armor was not purchased from france until <year>
the french navy decided in <year> to adopt compound armor for its fleet but found it limited in supply so from <year> the french navy was using steel armor
britain stuck to compound armor until <year>
the ultimate ironclad armor was case hardened nickel @-@ steel
in <year> the u
s
navy tested steel armor hardened by the harvey process and found it superior to compound armor
for several years harvey steel was the state of the art produced in the u
s
france germany britain austria and italy
in <year> the german firm krupp developed gas cementing which further hardened steel armor
the german kaiser friedrich iii laid down in <year> was the first ship to benefit from the new krupp armor and the new armor was quickly adopted the royal navy using it from hms canopus laid down in <year>
by <year> almost all new battleships used krupp armor though the u
s
continued to use harvey armor alongside until the end of the decade
the equivalent strengths of the different armor plates was as follows <num> in <num> mm of wrought iron was equivalent to <num> in <num> mm of either plain steel or compound iron and steel armor and to <num>
<num> in <num> mm of harvey armor or <num>
<num> in <num> mm of krupp armor
ironclad construction also <unk> the later debate in battleship design between tapering and all @-@ or @-@ nothing armour design
warrior was only semi @-@ armoured and could have been disabled by hits on the bow and stern
as the thickness of armor grew to protect ships from the increasingly heavy guns the area of the ship which could be fully protected diminished
inflexible 's armor protection was largely limited to the central citadel amidships protecting boilers and engines turrets and magazines and little else
an ingenious arrangement of cork @-@ filled compartments and watertight bulkheads was intended to keep her stable and afloat in the event of heavy damage to her un @-@ armored sections
early steam engines were inefficient the wooden steam fleet of the royal navy could only carry <num> to <num> days coal and the situation was similar with the early ironclads
warrior also illustrates two design features which aided hybrid propulsion she had retractable screws to reduce drag while under sail though in practice the steam engine was run at a low throttle and a <unk> funnel which could be folded down to the deck level
ships designed for coastal warfare like the floating batteries of the crimea or uss monitor and her sisters dispensed with masts from the beginning
the british hms devastation started in <year> was the first large ocean @-@ going ironclad to dispense with masts
her principal role was for combat in the english channel and other european waters and while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the atlantic she would have had little endurance on the other side of the ocean
the devastation and the similar ships commissioned by the british and russian navies in the <num> were the exception rather than the rule
most ironclads of the <num> retained masts and only the italian navy which during that decade was focused on short @-@ range operations in the adriatic built consistently <unk> ironclads
during the <num> steam engines improved with the adoption of double @-@ expansion steam engines which used <num> – <num> less coal than earlier models
the royal navy decided to switch to the double @-@ expansion engine in <year> and by <year> they were widespread
however this development alone was not enough to herald the end of the mast
whether this was due to a conservative desire to retain sails or was a rational response to the operational and strategic situation is a matter of debate
a steam @-@ only fleet would require a network of coaling stations worldwide which would need to be fortified at great expense to stop them falling into enemy hands
just as significantly because of <unk> problems with the technology of the boilers which provided steam for the engines the performance of double @-@ expansion engines was rarely as good in practice as it was in theory
during the <num> the distinction grew between first @-@ class ironclads or battleships on the one hand and cruising ironclads designed for long @-@ range work on the other
the demands on first @-@ class ironclads for very heavy armor and armament meant increasing displacement which reduced speed under sail and the fashion for turrets and barbettes made a sailing rig increasingly inconvenient
hms inflexible launched in <year> but not commissioned until <year> was the last british battleship to carry masts and these were widely seen as a mistake
the start of the <num> saw the end of sailing rig on ironclad battleships
sails persisted on cruising ironclads for much longer
during the <num> the french navy had produced the alma and la <unk> classes as small long @-@ range ironclads as overseas cruisers and the british had responded with ships like hms <unk> of <year>
the russian ship general @-@ admiral laid down in <year> and completed in <year> was a model of a fast long @-@ range ironclad which was likely to be able to <unk> and <unk> ships like <unk>
even the later hms shannon often described as the first british armored cruiser would have been too slow to <unk> general @-@ admiral
while shannon was the last british ship with a retractable <unk> later armored cruisers of the <num> retained sailing rig <unk> speed under steam in consequence
it took until <year> for the royal navy to lay down a long @-@ range armored warship capable of catching enemy commerce raiders hms warspite which was completed in <year>
while sailing rigs were obsolescent for all purposes by the end of the <num> rigged ships were in service until the early years of the <num> century
the final evolution of ironclad propulsion was the adoption of the triple @-@ expansion steam engine a further refinement which was first adopted in hms sans pareil laid down in <year> and commissioned in <year>
many ships also used a forced draught to get additional power from their engines and this system was widely used until the introduction of the steam turbine in the mid @-@ <num> decade
most european nations settled differences on land and the royal navy struggled to maintain a deterrent parity with at least france while providing suitable protection to britain 's commerce and colonial outposts worldwide
ironclads remained for the british royal navy a matter of defending the british isles first and projecting power abroad second
those naval engagements of the latter half of the <num> @-@ century which involved ironclads normally involved colonial actions or clashes between second @-@ rate naval powers
but these encounters were often enough to convince british policy @-@ makers of the increasing hazards of strictly naval foreign intervention from hampton roads in the american civil war to the hardening combined defences of naval arsenals such as kronstadt and cherbourg
there were many types of ironclads seagoing ships intended to stand in the line of battle the precursors of the battleship
the royal navy was the second to adopt ironclad warships and it applied them worldwide in their whole range of roles
in the age of sail the british strategy for war depended on the royal navy mounting a blockade of the ports of the enemy
because of the limited endurance of <unk> this was no longer possible so the british at times considered the risk @-@ laden plan of engaging an enemy fleet in harbor as soon as war broke out
to this end the royal navy developed a series of coast @-@ defence battleships starting with the devastation class
these breastwork monitors were markedly different from the other high @-@ seas ironclads of the period and were an important precursor of the modern battleship
as long @-@ range monitors they could reach bermuda <unk> for example
however they were still armed with only four heavy guns and were as vulnerable to mines and obstructions and enemy monitors as the original monitors of the union navy proved to be during the civil war
the british prepared for an overwhelming mortar bombardment of kronstadt by the close of the crimean war but never considered running the smoke @-@ ridden shallow @-@ water gauntlet straight to st
petersburg with ironclads
likewise monitors proved <unk> unable to overwhelm enemy fortifications single @-@ handed during the american conflict though their low @-@ profile and heavy armour protection made them ideal for running <unk>
mines and obstructions however negated these advantages — a problem the british admiralty frequently acknowledged but never countered throughout the period
the british never laid down enough devastation @-@ class battleships to instantly overwhelm cherbourg kronstadt or even new york city with gunfire
although throughout the <num> and <num> the royal navy was still in many respects superior to its potential rivals by the early <num> widespread concern about the threat from france and germany culminated in the naval defence act which promulgated the idea of a two @-@ power standard that britain should possess as many ships as the next two navies combined
this standard provoked aggressive shipbuilding in the <num> and <num>
british ships did not participate in any major wars in the ironclad period
the royal navy 's ironclads only saw action as part of colonial battles or one @-@ sided engagements like the bombardment of alexandria in <year>
defending british interests against ahmed <unk> 's egyptian revolt a british fleet opened fire on the fortifications around the port of alexandria
a mixture of centre @-@ battery and turret ships bombarded egyptian positions for most of a day forcing the egyptians to retreat return fire from egyptian guns was heavy at first but inflicted little damage killing only five british sailors
few egyptian guns were actually dismounted on the other hand and the fortifications themselves were typically left intact
had the egyptians actually utilised the heavy mortars that were at their disposal they might have quickly turned the tide for the attacking british ironclads found it easy for accuracy 's sake to simply anchor whilst firing — perfect targets for high @-@ angle fire upon their thinly armoured <unk>
the french navy built the first ironclad to try to gain a strategic advantage over the british but were consistently out @-@ built by the british
despite taking the lead with a number of innovations like breech @-@ loading weapons and steel construction the french navy could never match the size of the royal navy
in the <num> the construction of ironclads ceased for a while in france as the <unk> <unk> school of naval thought took prominence suggesting that torpedo boats and unarmored cruisers would be the future of warships
like the british the french navy saw little action with its ironclads the french blockade of germany in the franco @-@ prussian war was ineffective as the war was settled entirely on land
russia built a number of ironclads generally copies of british or french designs
nonetheless there were real innovations from russia the first true type of ironclad armored cruiser the general @-@ admiral of the <num> and a set of remarkably badly designed circular battleships referred to as <unk> for admiral <unk> who conceived the design
the russian navy pioneered the wide @-@ scale use of torpedo boats during the russo @-@ turkish war of <year> – <year> mainly out of necessity because of the superior numbers and quality of ironclads used by the turkish navy
russia expanded her navy in the <num> and <num> with modern armored cruisers and battleships but the ships were manned by inexperienced crews and politically appointed leadership which enhanced their defeat in the battle of <unk> on <num> may <year>
the u
s
navy ended the civil war with about fifty monitor @-@ type coastal ironclads by the <num> most of these were laid up in reserve leaving the usa virtually without an ironclad fleet
another five large monitors were ordered in the <num>
the limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the usa from projecting power overseas and until the <num> the usa would have come off badly in a conflict with even spain or the latin american powers
the <num> saw the beginning of what became the great white fleet and it was the modern pre @-@ dreadnoughts and armored cruisers built in the <num> which defeated the spanish fleet in the spanish – american war of <year>
this started a new era of naval warfare
ironclads were widely used in south america
both sides used ironclads in the <unk> islands war between spain and the combined forces of peru and chile in the early <num>
the powerful spanish <unk> participated in the battle of <unk> but was unable to inflict significant damage to the <unk> defences
besides peru was able to deploy two locally built ironclads based on american civil war designs the <unk> a wooden ship converted into a casemate ironclad and the victoria a small monitor armed with a single <num> @-@ pdr gun as well as two british @-@ built ironclads <unk> a centre @-@ battery ship and the turret ship <unk>
<unk> was the first ironclad to <unk> the world arriving in cádiz on <num> september <year> and earning the motto <unk> <unk> que primo <unk> <unk> first ironclad ship to sail around the world
in the war of the pacific in <year> both peru and chile had ironclad warships including some of those used a few years previously against spain
while the <unk> ran aground early on the peruvian ironclad <unk> made a great impact against chilean shipping delaying chilean ground invasion by six months
she was eventually caught by two more modern chilean centre @-@ battery ironclads the <unk> <unk> and the almirante cochrane at the battle of <unk> point
ironclads were also used from the inception of the imperial japanese navy
the <unk> japanese <unk> literally ironclad later renamed azuma <unk> east had a decisive role in the naval battle of <unk> bay in may <year> which marked the end of the <unk> war and the complete establishment of the <unk> restoration
the <unk> continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from british and european shipyards first ironclads and later armored cruisers
these ships engaged the chinese <unk> fleet which was superior on paper at least at the battle of the <unk> river
thanks to superior short @-@ range firepower the japanese fleet came off better sinking or severely damaging eight ships and receiving serious damage to only four
the naval war was concluded the next year at the battle of <unk> where the strongest remaining chinese ships were surrendered to the japanese
ironclads continued to be used in world war i
towards the end of the <num> century the descriptions battleship and armored cruiser came to replace the term ironclad
the proliferation of ironclad battleship designs came to an end in the <num> as navies reached a consensus on the design of battleships producing the type known as the pre @-@ dreadnought
these ships are sometimes covered in treatments of the ironclad warship
the next evolution of battleship design the dreadnought is never referred to as an ironclad
most of the ironclads of the <num> and <num> served into the <num> decade
for instance a handful of us navy monitors laid down in the <num> saw active service in world war i
pre @-@ dreadnought battleships and cruisers of the <num> saw widespread action in world war i and in some cases through to world war ii

s
eliot 's four <unk> a series of poems that discuss time perspective humanity and salvation
it was first published in september <year> after being delayed for over a year because of the air @-@ raids on great britain during world war ii and eliot 's declining health
the title refers to a small anglican community in <unk> established by nicholas <unk> in the <num> century and scattered during the english civil war
the poem uses the combined image of fire and <unk> fire to emphasise the need for purification and <unk>
according to the poet humanity 's flawed understanding of life and turning away from god leads to a cycle of warfare but this can be overcome by recognising the lessons of the past
within the poem the narrator meets a ghost that is a combination of various poets and literary figures
little <unk> focuses on the unity of past present and future and claims that understanding this unity is necessary for salvation
during this time eliot started writing little <unk>
the first draft was completed in july <year> but he was dissatisfied with it
he believed the problems with the poem lay with his own inability to write and that precipitated by air raids on london he had started the poem with too little preparation and had written it too quickly
after the first draft was written he set the poem aside and he left in september to lecture throughout great britain
after months of not working on the poem eliot began to feel compelled to finish it it was not until august <year> however that he started working on it again
in total there were five drafts
the poem was finished by <num> september <year> and published in the october new english weekly
little <unk> was intended to conclude the four <unk> series summarising eliot 's views expressed in this series of poems
little <unk> was the home of an anglican community established in <year> by nicholas <unk>
the <unk> household lived a christian life according to high church principles and the book of common prayer
the religious community was dispersed during the english civil war between parliamentarians and royalists but reformed ending with the death of john <unk> in <year>
eliot had visited the site in may <year>
unlike the other locations mentioned in the titles of the four <unk> poems eliot had no direct connection to the original christian community
as such the community is supposed to represent almost any religious community
the beginning of the poem discusses time and winter with attention paid to the arrival of summer
the images of snow which provoke desires for a spiritual life transition into an analysis of the four classical elements of fire earth air and water and how fire is the primary element of the four
following this is a discussion on death and destruction things <unk> and regret for past events
while using dante 's <unk> <unk> style the poem continues by describing the battle of britain
the image of warfare merges with the depiction of <unk> and the holy spirit is juxtaposed with the air @-@ raids on london
in the second section a ghost representing the poets of the past stuck between worlds begins talking to the narrator of the poem
the ghost discusses change art in general and how humankind is flawed
the only way to overcome the problematic condition of humanity according to the ghost is to experience <unk> through fire
the fire is described in a manner similar to julian of norwich 's writing about god 's love and discussed in relationship to the shirt of <unk> a shirt that burns its wearer
little <unk> continues by describing the <unk> of the present and how history exists in a pattern
the poem concludes by explaining how sacrifice is needed to allow an individual to die into life and be reborn and that salvation should be the goal of humankind
the original little <unk> community was built for living on monastic lines but the community was damaged and dispersed by puritan forces during the english civil war in <year>
the church the centre of the community was restored in <year> and again in <year>
the image of religious renewal is combined with the image of the london air @-@ raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world
this compound image is used to discuss the connection of holy places with the holy spirit <unk> communion with the dead and the repetition of history
the theme is also internal to eliot 's own poems the image of the rose garden at the end little <unk> is the image that begins burnt norton and the journey is made circular
also the depiction of time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within the family reunion
like the other poems making up the four <unk> little <unk> deals with the past present and future and humanity 's place within them as each generation is seemingly united
in the second section there is a ghost who is the compilation of various poets including dante swift yeats and others
when the ghost joins the poet the narrator states knowing myself yet being someone other
this suggests that the different times merge at the same time that the different personalities begin to merge allowing a communication and connection with the dead
later in the fourth section humanity is given a choice between the holy spirit or the bombing of london redemption or destruction
god 's love allows humankind to be redeemed and escape the living hell through <unk> by fire
the end of the poem describes how eliot has attempted to help the world as a poet
he parallels his work in language with working on the soul or working on society
the ghost a combination of many literary figures was originally addressed in the poem as ser <unk> before being revised as an ambiguous you
ser <unk> was dante 's way of addressing <unk> <unk> a former mentor whom he meets in hell to which he has been condemned for <unk>
eliot in a letter to john <unk> dated <num> august <year> explained why he changed the wording i think you will recognise that it was necessary to get rid of <unk> for two reasons
the first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with yeats though i do not mean anything so precise as that
however i do not wish to take the responsibility of putting yeats or anybody else into hell and i do not want to <unk> to him the particular vice which took <unk> there
secondly although the reference to that canto is intended to be explicit i wish the effect of the whole to be <unk> which is more appropriate
that brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of <unk> <num> where the poets are found
the theme of swimming through flames is connected to the depiction of guido <unk> a poet that influenced dante seeking such a state in <unk> xxvi
however the depiction of swimming was transformed into an image of dancing an act that appears throughout yeats 's poetry within <unk> flames
the critic dominic <unk> suggests that in combining the image of dancing with <unk> eliot merges dante 's and yeats 's poetic themes
<unk> emphasised the mystical nature of the poem and how its themes were closer to buddhism than <unk> while mentioning his appreciation of many of the passages
schwartz also mentioned the buddhist images and his admiration for many of the lines in little <unk>
f
b
<unk> believed that the fourth section of the poem costs eliot more trouble and <unk> than any passage of the same length he ever wrote and is his greatest achievement in the four <unk>
e
m
forster did not like eliot 's emphasis on pain and responded to the poem of course there 's pain on and off through each individual 's life
you can 't <unk> it and so on
but why should it be endorsed by the schoolmaster and <unk> by the priest until the fire and the rose are one when so much of it is caused by disease and bullies it is here that eliot becomes unsatisfactory as a seer
writing in <year> roger <unk> wrote that in little <unk> eliot achieved that for which he <unk> dante — namely a poetry of belief in which belief and words are one and in which the thought cannot be prized free from the controlled and beautiful language

is a <year> literary and philosophical novella by george steiner in which jewish nazi hunters find a fictional adolf hitler a
h
alive in the amazon jungle thirty years after the end of world war ii
the book generated considerable controversy after its publication because in it steiner who is jewish allows hitler to defend himself when he is put on trial in the jungle by his captors
there hitler maintains that israel owes its existence to the holocaust and that he is the benefactor of the jews
the portage to san cristobal of a
h
was a <year> finalist in the pen faulkner award for fiction
it was adapted for the theatre by british playwright christopher hampton and was staged in london in april <year> with alec mccowen playing the part of adolf hitler
it was also staged in hartford connecticut in the united states in <year> and starred john <unk> as hitler
<unk> believes that the former <unk> is still alive and following rumours and <unk> he tracks hitler 's movements through south america until after months of wading through swamps in the amazon jungle the search party finds the <num> @-@ year @-@ old alive in a clearing
<unk> flies to san cristóbal where he awaits the group 's return with their captive
but getting the old man out of the jungle alive is more difficult than getting in and their progress is further hampered by heavy thunderstorms
meanwhile broken and incoherent radio messages between <unk> and the search party are intercepted by intelligence agents tracking their progress and rumours begin to spread across the world of hitler 's capture
debates flare up over his impending trial where it will be held and under whose jurisdiction
<unk> is identified as the nearest airfield to the last known location of the search party and aircraft begin arriving at the hitherto unknown town
but when the search party loses radio contact with <unk> they must make a decision do they sit out the storms and deliver their captive to <unk> later or do they try hitler in the jungle before their prize is <unk> from them by the world at large who they know will be waiting their decision is the latter and against <unk> 's advice you must not let him speak
his tongue is like no other they prepare for a trial with a judge prosecution and defence attorneys selected from the members of the search party
<unk> a local indian tracker is asked to observe the trial as an independent witness
the attention hitler is receiving however renews his strength and when the trial begins he brushes aside his defence attorney and begins a long speech in four parts in his own defence firstly hitler claims he took his doctrines from the jews and copied the notion of the master race from the chosen people and their need to separate themselves from the unclean
my racism is a parody of yours a hungry imitation
hitler justifies the final solution by maintaining that the jews god purer than any other <unk> its subjects continually demanding more than they can give and <unk> them with ideals that cannot be attained
the virus of utopia had to be stopped
hitler states that he was not the originator of evil
stalin had <unk> genocide when i was still a nameless <unk> in munich
further hitler asserts that the number of lives lost due to his actions are dwarfed by various world atrocities including those in russia china and africa
lastly hitler maintains that the reich <unk> israel and suggests that he is the messiah whose infamous deeds were allowed by god in order to bring his people home
he closes by asking should you not honour me who have made
zion a reality at the end of his speech <unk> is the first to react and jumps up shouting proven only to be drowned out by the appearance of a helicopter over the clearing
search party all jewish with family ties to the holocaust except for john asher <unk> – search party leader and presiding judge at hitler 's trial he is <unk> 's <unk> and torn between leading the party into <unk> quicksand and green bogs and turning his back on the quiet mania of <unk> 's conviction

elie <unk> – orthodox jew and prosecution attorney at the trial he is the moral compass of the group but his convictions are disturbed by gideon <unk> 's fever @-@ induced assertions that hitler is jewish and ends up believing that hitler may be the second messiah
isaac <unk> – an <num> @-@ year @-@ old boy and witness at the trial he is the son of isaac <unk> senior former member of the search party killed earlier in a <unk> in são paulo he joined the party to avenge his father 's death
john asher – half @-@ jewish and reluctant defence attorney at the trial fascinated by the capture of <unk> and the rumours circulating that hitler may be alive he had approached nazi hunter <unk> who directed him to <unk> despite being an outsider no ties to the holocaust <unk> assigned him to the search party because of his military training and his clear @-@ <unk> no metaphysical lusts no cravings for retribution
<unk> – local indian tracker and independent witness at the trial previously the search party 's guide who had abandoned them when they insisted on entering <unk> regions of the jungle he continued tracking them from a distance before revealing himself
adolf hitler – now <num> years old the former leader of the third reich had not died in the <unk> in berlin but escaped to south america and hid in the amazon jungle
many of the ideas steiner expresses in the portage to san cristobal of a
h
were reworked from these earlier works
steiner told new york times editor d
j
r
<unk> that this book arose out of his lifelong work on language
central to everything i am and believe and have written is my astonishment
that you can use human speech both to bless to love to build to forgive and also to torture to hate to destroy and to annihilate
commenting on the controversy the book generated steiner admitted to literary journalist and critic ron <unk> author of explaining hitler that he too was disturbed by it adding that his fictional hitler had gotten the better of him <unk> or frankenstein @-@ like
he said that it felt like the book wrote me
steiner also pointed out that the novella is not only about his thoughts on the holocaust but also about the horrific events that took place in countries like cambodia vietnam el salvador and burundi my feeling is that one has to <unk> with the abyss if one can
steiner wrote the portage to san cristobal of a
h
in <year> and <year> in geneva switzerland and the <num> @-@ page work originally appeared in the spring <year> issue of the united states literary magazine the kenyon review
it also appeared in the spring <year> issue of <unk> the british literary magazine
its first publication in book form with minor revisions by steiner was in may <year> by faber and faber in the united kingdom — and as requested by steiner it was a paperback original
the first united states edition was published in hardcover in april <year> by simon schuster

mccowen won the <year> evening standard theatre award for best actor for this performance
in <year> the production moved to the united states where it played at the hartford stage company in hartford connecticut directed by mark <unk> and starring john <unk> as hitler
this book is the only work of fiction by steiner to have been adapted for the stage
h
was mixed
anthony burgess in the observer called it astonishing christopher booker of the daily telegraph described it as a powerful piece and english author a
s
<unk> said it was a masterpiece
in explaining hitler ron <unk> called the portage a frankenstein story referring to steiner 's fictive hitler has having taken on a life of its own
writing in time magazine otto friedrich described the book a philosophic fantasy of remarkable intensity adding that by not refuting hitler 's speech steiner deviates from the horrors of traditional holocaust literature and ends the book on a note of bleak ambiguity
morris <unk> of the new york times was more critical of the book calling it a misconceived and badly executed novel a sideshow distraction from the serious business of thinking through the unspeakable horrors of the nazi era
he described it as <unk> that is suffocate d by too much fine writing belles @-@ <unk>
he also complained that the characters are lifeless and while they each have detailed histories they are only verbal <unk> that do not separate them from one another
finally <unk> noted that because almost all the points of hitler 's speech are drawn from some of steiner 's earlier works he unwittingly creates sympathy for hitler by making him old and pathetic yet also <unk> and brilliant — at once <unk> harmless and <unk> dangerous
in another review in the new york times john leonard wrote that while the book has its strong points some wit a catholic disdain multiplicity of character and a south american swamp @-@ life that terrifies its weaknesses are that the characters are really ideas
the symbols clash and there are too many echoes of better books by <unk> and proust
but leonard 's biggest criticism of the book was hitler 's speech which he called obscene and steiner 's decision to end the book at that point which leonard said not only denies the power of art to arrange and transcend but
makes me sick to my stomach
writing in the american literary magazine <unk> alvin h
<unk> called the portage a breakthrough work that <unk>
he was struck by the book 's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle and the landscape of speech — the former being brilliantly registered with its immense feeling of physicality and the latter even more dramatic in the way it exposes the dark underside of words and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person
he was particularly impressed by the depiction of nazi hunter emmanuel <unk> and his role as representative of the jewish consciousness
<unk> noted that while holocaust literature often either soars to <unk> and apostrophe or sinks to a dwindling sob of elegiac lament steiner 's <unk> mediates between these two extremes
simultaneously records and <unk> coldly enumerates yet carries an immense affect
what did concern the reviewer however was the way steiner used ideas from his earlier works that he had put them virtually <unk> into hitler 's mouth creating the impression that steiner 's understanding of hitler were identical with the latter 's self @-@ understanding
<unk> also questioned why the book had to end with hitler 's speech
he said that steiner 's fictive hitler plays the devil 's game of language subversion making madness sound like music something the real hitler had <unk>
by stopping at this point <unk> felt that steiner <unk> s rhetorically to the seductive eloquence of negation which undermines his own high standards of moral intelligence
but overall <unk> said the portage must be counted among the most vigorous attempts to portray the presence and meaning of hitler forcing us to confront him in a way hardly seen before in fiction
the portage to san cristobal of a
h
was a finalist in the <year> pen faulkner award for fiction
the controversy grew further when the faithful stage adaptation too faithful according to steiner was performed in the united kingdom and the united states
hitler 's speech at the end of the book disturbed many readers and critics
steiner not only lets hitler justify his past he allows him the almost last word before the outside world invades
the fact that steiner is jewish made this speech in particular even more contentious
one critic while acknowledging that steiner always saw hitler as the incarnation of unprecedented and unparalleled evil felt that there was no clear distinction in the book between steiner 's own views and those of his fictional hitler even going so far as to accuse steiner who rejects jewish nationalism and is a critic of israel 's treatment of the palestinians of anti @-@ semitism
in contrast a time magazine article at the time felt that steiner 's intention for the hitler speech was to use it to explore his previously stated belief that hitler wielded language as an almost supernatural force drawing attention to nazi hunter emmanuel <unk> 's warning from the book regarding hitler there shall come a man who
will know the grammar of hell and teach it to others
he will know the sounds of madness and loathing and make them seem music
steiner responded to criticism that hitler 's speech in this book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before for example satan 's speech in milton 's paradise lost <year> and the grand <unk> 's speech in <unk> 's the brothers <unk> <year>
he also reminded the reader that hitler 's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by <unk> 's long monologue on the horrors of the holocaust
finally steiner said that his hitler a
h
is a fictive figure and that it is not he who has the last word but <unk> the indian tracker who shouts proven
<unk> is also the hebrew word used to indicate that there are issues here beyond our wisdom to answer or decide
a few species continued into the cretaceous
fossils have been found on every continent
during about <num> million years of evolutionary history they adapted to a wide range of habitats including fresh water terrestrial and even coastal marine environments
their life history is well understood with fossils known from the larval stage metamorphosis and maturity
most <unk> were <unk> although some were almost fully terrestrial returning to the water only to breed
these <unk> were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land
although <unk> are considered amphibians many had characteristics such as scales claws and armour @-@ like bony plates that distinguish them from modern amphibians
<unk> have been known since the early <num> century and were initially thought to be reptiles
they were described at various times as <unk> <unk> and <unk> although these names are now rarely used
animals now grouped in <unk> were spread out among several amphibian groups until the early <num> century when they were found to belong to a distinct taxon based on the structure of their vertebrae
<unk> means cut vertebrae as each vertebra is divided into several parts
experts disagree over whether <unk> were ancestral to modern amphibians frogs <unk> and <unk> or whether the whole group died out without leaving any descendants
different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the descendants of <unk> another group of early <unk> called <unk> or even as descendants of both groups with <unk> evolving from <unk> and frogs and <unk> evolving from <unk>
recent studies place a family of <unk> called the <unk> as the closest relatives of modern amphibians
similarities in teeth skulls and hearing structures link the two groups
others are smaller and resemble <unk>
most have broad flat heads that are either blunt <unk> or elongated <unk>
the skulls are rounded or triangular in shape when viewed from above and are usually covered in pits and ridges
the rugged surfaces of bones may have supported blood vessels which could transfer carbon dioxide to the bones to neutralize acidic build up in the blood early <unk> <unk> would have had difficulty expelling carbon dioxide from their bodies while on land and these dermal bones may have been an early solution to the problem
many <unk> also have canal @-@ like grooves in their skulls called sensory <unk>
the <unk> which usually run around the nostrils and eye sockets are part of a lateral line system used to detect <unk> in water
as <unk> animals most <unk> have small limbs with four toes on each front foot and five on each hind foot
terrestrial <unk> have larger thicker limbs and some even have claws
one unusual terrestrial <unk> <unk> has relatively long limbs for its body and probably lived as an active runner able to chase prey
<unk> of most of the bones of <unk> are also seen in other early <unk> aside from a few bones in the skull such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> that have developed in some <unk> taxa
most <unk> have <unk> horns in the backs of their skulls rounded projections of bone separated from the rest of the skull by <unk> called <unk> <unk> in some <unk> such as <unk> they are pointed and very prominent
among the most distinguishing features of <unk> are the <unk> <unk> two large holes in the back of the palate
another pair of holes <unk> are present in front of these <unk> and connect the nasal passage with the mouth
<unk> often have teeth on their <unk> as well as in their jaws
some of these teeth are so large they are referred to as tusks
in some <unk> such as <unk> tusks in the lower jaw pierce the palate and emerge through openings in the top of the skull
very little is known of the soft tissue of <unk>
a block of sandstone described in <year> from the early carboniferous <unk> chunk formation of pennsylvania included impressions of the bodies of three <unk>
these impressions show when alive they had smooth skin robust limbs with webbed feet and a ridge of skin on their undersides
trackways referable to small <unk> have also been found in carboniferous and <unk> rocks
the trackways called <unk> are usually found in strata deposited around freshwater environments suggesting the animals had some ties to the water
unlike modern amphibians many <unk> are covered in small closely packed scales
the undersides of most <unk> are covered in rows of large ventral plates
during early stages of development they first have only small rounded scales
fossils show as the animals grew the scales on the undersides of their bodies developed into large wide ventral plates
the plates overlap each other in a way that allows a wide range of flexibility
later <unk> <unk> such as <unk> and <unk> have no evidence of scales
they may have lost scales to make movement easier under water or to allow <unk> <unk> the absorption of oxygen through the skin
several groups of <unk> have large bony plates on their backs
one <unk> <unk> has armour @-@ like plating that covers both its back and underside
the <unk> <unk> also has extensive plating on its back
most members of the family <unk> also have armor although it only covers the midline of the back with two narrow rows of plates
other <unk> such as <unk> have been found with small disc @-@ like bony <unk> that were in life probably embedded in the skin
all of these <unk> were adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle
armor may have offered protection from predators in the case of <unk>
the <unk> may have provided stability for the spine as they would have limited flexibility and may have been connected by strong ligaments
<unk> such as <unk> and <unk> that may have been at least partly terrestrial also have long neural spines on top of their vertebrae that would have stabilized the spine
bony <unk> are also seen in <unk> but unlike <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> these animals are thought to have been fully aquatic
<unk> may have inherited their armor from a terrestrial ancestor as both <unk> and <unk> have been considered close relatives of the group
<unk> vertebrae are divided into several segments
in living <unk> the main body of the vertebra is a single piece of bone called the <unk> but in <unk> this region was divided into a <unk> and <unk>
two types of vertebrae are recognized in <unk> <unk> and <unk> vertebrae
in <unk> vertebrae the <unk> are large and wedge @-@ shaped and the <unk> are relatively small blocks that fit between them
both elements support a spine @-@ like neural arch and well @-@ developed interlocking projections called <unk> strengthen the connections between vertebrae
the strong backbone and strong limbs of many <unk> <unk> allowed them to be partially and in some cases fully terrestrial
in <unk> vertebrae the <unk> have been lost entirely with the <unk> enlarged as the main body of the vertebrae
this weaker type of backbone indicates the <unk> <unk> spent more time in water
<unk> remains were known since the early part of the <num> century however
the earliest described <unk> was <unk> named by georg friedrich jaeger in <year>
jaeger named <unk> from a single tooth and considered it a reptile
<unk> means breast tooth lizard after the nipple @-@ like shape of the tip of the tooth
the naming of these first specimens was disputed however
leopold fitzinger named the animal <unk> in <year>
in <year> english palaeontologist richard owen referred to the genus as <unk> to describe its highly folded or labyrinthine teeth
owen thought the name <unk> ought not to be retained because it recalls <unk> the idea of the mammalian genus mastodon or else a <unk> form of the tooth
and because the second element of the word saurus indicates a false affinity the remains belonging not to the saurian but to the <unk> order of reptiles
owen recognized the animal was not a saurian reptile yet he also referred jaeger 's <unk> to the genus
although the two genera both have similarly sized conical teeth <unk> was later found to be a crocodile @-@ like reptile
additional material including skulls firmly placed <unk> as an amphibian
jaeger also named <unk> giganteus in <year> basing it on partial <unk> or back portion of the skull
in <year> he described a complete skull of s
giganteus that had the same teeth as his <unk> making it the first known complete skull of a <unk>
because <unk> was named first it has precedence over the other names as a senior <unk> synonym
<unk> is still used as the name of an unrelated <unk> <unk>
<unk> and other similar animals were referred to as <unk> named like <unk> for teeth that were highly folded in cross section
owen 's <unk> <unk> was later found at guy 's <unk> england by paleontologist william buckland
other specimens were found in the red sandstone of warwickshire
as more fossils were uncovered in england owen depicted these <unk> as the highest form of <unk> and compared them to crocodiles which he considered the highest form of reptiles
he also noted the large <unk> of the keuper a unit of rocks that dates to the late <unk> were younger than more advanced reptiles in the <unk> and <unk> which are late <unk> in age
owen used these fossils to counter the notion that reptiles evolved from a sequential progression from early amphibians what he called metamorphosed fishes
in addition to <unk> some of the earliest named genera included <unk> and <unk> in <year> <unk> in <year> <unk> in <year> <unk> and <unk> in <year> <unk> in <year> and <unk> in <year>
<unk> is now placed as an early <unk> outside <unk> and <unk> is now considered a <unk> reptile
later in the <num> century <unk> were classified as various members of <unk> a name coined by american paleontologist edward drinker cope in <year>
cope placed <unk> in the class <unk> the name then used for <unk>
<unk> means roof @-@ headed in greek a reference to the wide flat heads of <unk> and other early <unk>
during this time <unk> considered <unk> to be amphibians because they possessed three main features gill arches in juvenile skeletons indicating they were amphibious for at least the first part of their lives ribs that do not connect at the underside of the rib cage and deep pits in the skull that were interpreted as space for mucous glands
several <unk> of <unk> were recognized in the late <num> and early <num> centuries
animals now regarded as <unk> were primarily <unk> but some were classified in the <unk>
<unk> were small @-@ bodied and had simple conical teeth while <unk> were larger and had complex folded <unk> and enamel in their teeth
<unk> included only a few forms such as <unk> from europe and <unk> from north america that had poorly developed bones external gills and no ribs
some skeletons of <unk> were later found with long ribs prompting its reassignment to <unk> although more detailed studies found it to be a <unk>
soft tissue such as scales and external gills were found in many well @-@ preserved <unk> fossils from germany
in the early <num> century <unk> would be recognized as larval forms of <unk> lacking many of the typical features that define the group and is no longer recognized as a distinct group
other animals that would later be classified as <unk> were placed in a group called <unk> characterized by plate @-@ like skull bones small limbs fish @-@ like scales and <unk> arches
unlike <unk> they did not have parietal <unk> small holes in their skulls behind their eye sockets
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> were placed in this group and were considered to be the most primitive members of <unk>
their <unk> vertebrae <unk> and lack of occipital <unk> which attached the head to the neck were features that were also shared with fishes
thus they were considered a link between early fishes and more advanced forms such as <unk>
another group called <unk> was named by cope in <year>
cope classified <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> placing many small amphibian @-@ like animals within it
among them were <unk> once placed in <unk>
<unk> was later placed as a <unk> with other <unk> but confusion existed for many years over the classification of small amphibians
by the end of the <num> century most of what are today regarded as <unk> were placed in the suborder <unk>
american paleontologist <unk> cowles case called it <unk> vera or true <unk>
the names <unk> and <unk> were used interchangeably to refer to the order in which it belonged
the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> both of which contain <unk> were distinct from <unk>
within <unk> were the groups <unk> <unk> and <unk>
members of <unk> such as <unk> and <unk> had <unk> vertebrae with enlarged <unk> that displaced the <unk>
<unk> such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> had lost their <unk> and the <unk> made up the entire body of the vertebrae
<unk> had <unk> and <unk> that were of equal size
<unk> are now identified as <unk> distantly related to <unk>
in <year> von zittel divided <unk> among three taxa <unk> <unk> and <unk>
he placed <unk> in <unk> a group which he characterized as having simple <unk> @-@ shaped vertebral <unk>
<unk> included forms with the <unk> divided into <unk> and <unk>
all members of <unk> had <unk> <unk> composed only of the <unk>
cope objected to von zittel 's classification considering the vertebrae of <unk> and <unk> indistinguishable because each had a simple <unk> shape
he continued to use <unk> and <unk> which he alternatively referred to as <unk> to distinguish animals based on the absence or presence of occipital <unk>
<unk> became a commonly used name at the turn of the century
paleontologists included both <unk> and <unk> in the group
cope 's <unk> and <unk> fell out of use
in <year> british paleontologist d
m
s
watson proposed that the evolutionary history of these large amphibians could be seen through changes in their vertebrae
<unk> forms in the carboniferous graded into <unk> forms in the <unk> and finally into <unk> in the <unk>
more importantly watson began using the term <unk> to refer to these groups
the name <unk> was rarely used in the decades that followed
swedish paleontologist gunnar <unk> @-@ <unk> removed <unk> from the group narrowing its scope to <unk> and <unk>
his classification of <unk> was based heavily on characteristics of the skull rather than the vertebrae
american paleontologist alfred romer brought the name <unk> back into use in the later <num> century
<unk> @-@ <unk> used the name <unk> in a strict sense <unk> <unk> to refer to <unk> and <unk> excluding <unk>
romer agreed with this classification but used the name <unk> to avoid confusion with <unk> in its wider sense <unk> <unk>
unlike modern <unk> classification however romer included the primitive <unk> in the group
during the carboniferous <unk> included basal medium @-@ sized forms such as <unk> or large <unk> forms such as <unk>
other more derived <unk> such as the <unk> were smaller and more terrestrial
they resembled <unk> and some taxa such as the genus <unk> even retained external gills like the modern @-@ day <unk>
during the latest carboniferous and early <unk> around <num> mya several groups such as the <unk> and <unk> evolved strong robust limbs and vertebrae and became adapted to life on land while others such as the <unk> developed into large <unk> predators
the <unk> a group of small aquatic <unk> evolved from terrestrial ancestors in the late carboniferous
other <unk> such as <unk> developed long <unk> and a close similarity to crocodiles although they lacked the armor characteristic of the latter group
these <unk> included the largest known amphibian the <num> @-@ m @-@ long <unk> of brazil
<num> <num>
<num> mya a major group called <unk> became more dependent on life in the water
the vertebrae became weak the limbs small and the skull large and flat with the eyes facing upwards
during the <unk> period these animals dominated the freshwater ecosystems evolving in a range of both small and large forms
during the early <unk> <num>
<num> <num>
<num> mya one group of successful long @-@ snouted fish @-@ eaters the <unk> even adapted to a life in the sea the only known amphibians to do so with the exception of the modern crab @-@ eating frog
another group the <unk> included medium- and large @-@ sized animals <num>
<num> to <num> m <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> ft in length with large and flat skulls that could be over a meter long in the largest forms such as <unk>
these animals spent most or all their lives in water as aquatic predators catching their prey by a sudden opening of the upper jaw and sucking in fish or other small animals
in the <unk> stage of the late <unk> <num>
<num> <num>
<num> mya <unk> were joined by the superficially very similar <unk>
<unk> are distinguished from <unk> by the positioning of their eye sockets near the front of their skulls
another group of <unk> the <unk> had wide heads with external gills and adapted to life at the bottom of lakes and rivers
by this time <unk> had become a common and widespread component of <unk> ecosystems
some <unk> such as <unk> and <unk> even inhabited antarctica which was covered in temperate forests at the time
<unk> <unk> were often the dominant <unk> animals in their environments
large <unk> of <unk> with hundreds of individuals preserved together have been found in the southwestern united states
they have often been interpreted as mass death events caused by droughts in floodplain environments
recent studies show these dense <unk> were instead probably the result of currents accumulating dead individuals in certain areas
these environments seem to have had little diversity as they were inhabited almost exclusively by <unk>
the <unk> @-@ jurassic extinction event around <num>
<num> mya led to the extinction of most <unk> <unk>
the <unk> survived as well as a few <unk> and <unk>
while the latter two groups soon became extinct <unk> persisted and grew to large sizes during the jurassic
among <unk> the <unk> flourished in china and the <unk> became common in gondwana
the most recent known <unk> was the giant <unk> <unk> known from the early cretaceous of australia
it survived in rift valleys that were too cold in the winter for crocodiles that normally would have competed with them
<unk> was one of the largest of the <unk> with an estimated weight of <num> kg <num> @,@ <num> lb
early forms with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements were placed in the suborder <unk> and large <unk> aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder <unk>
with the recent growth of phylogenetics this classification is no longer viable
the basic <unk> condition is found in many primitive <unk> and is not unique to one group of <unk>
moreover the distinction between <unk> and <unk> vertebrae is not entirely clear
some <unk> have <unk> <unk> and <unk> vertebrae at different points in the same vertebral column
other taxa have intermediate morphologies that do not fit into any category
<unk> is no longer recognized as a group but <unk> is still considered valid
additional features were given by godfrey et al
<year> including the contact between the <unk> and <unk> at the back of the skull small projections <unk> processes on the ribs and a pelvic girdle with each side having a single <unk> blade
these shared characteristics are called synapomorphies
<unk> are placed as basal <unk> in phylogenetic analyses with their exact positioning varying between studies
depending on the classification of modern amphibians they are either included in the crown group <unk> or the stem of <unk>
crown @-@ group <unk> are descendants of the most recent common ancestor of all living <unk> and stem <unk> are forms that are outside the crown group
modern amphibians have recently been suggested as descendants of <unk> which would place them within crown <unk>
below is a cladogram from <unk> et al
<year> placing <unk> within crown <unk> other studies place modern amphibians as the descendants of <unk> and place <unk> in a more basal position within the stem of <unk>
below is a cladogram from <unk> and <unk> <year> placing <unk> outside crown <unk> most phylogenetic analyses of <unk> interrelationships focus on individual families
one of the first broad @-@ scale studies of <unk> phylogeny was conducted by paleontologist andrew milner in <year>
a <year> study made a <unk> of all <unk> families combining the family @-@ level trees of previous studies
the following cladogram is modified from <unk> et al
<year> <num> <unk> <num> <unk> <num> <unk> <num> <unk> <num> <unk> <num> <unk> <num> <unk> <num> <unk> <num> <unk> <num> <unk> <num> <unk> <num> <unk> <num> <unk> <num> <unk> the most basal group of <unk> is the superfamily <unk>
<unk> have several primitive or plesiomorphic features including a single occipital <unk> and a bone called the <unk> that is absent in other <unk>
<unk> include the late carboniferous genus <unk> and the family <unk>
<unk> has also been included in <unk> and is the oldest known <unk> family
<unk> <unk> is the oldest species having been present over <num> million years ago during the <unk> stage of the early carboniferous
recent analyses place <unk> outside <unk> in a more derived position
other primitive <unk> include <unk> and <unk>
<unk> and <unk> both described in <year> from <unk> are also primitive yet come from the late <unk>
they are almost <num> million years younger than other basal <unk> implying a long ghost lineage of species that are not yet known in the fossil record
in <year> paleontologists adam yates and anne warren produced a revised phylogeny of more derived <unk> naming several new clades
two major clades were <unk> and <unk>
<unk> includes the <unk> that were once called <unk> and includes two subfamilies the <unk> and the <unk>
<unk> include small mostly terrestrial <unk> that may be the ancestors of modern amphibians
<unk> include larger <unk> like <unk>
the second major clade <unk> includes most <unk> <unk> as well as some <unk> groups
within <unk> are the superfamily <unk> and the most derived <unk> the <unk>
yates and warren also named <unk> a clade of small aquatic <unk> from the carboniferous <unk> and <unk>
they placed <unk> within <unk> but more recent studies disagree on their position
for example a <year> study places them even more basal than <unk> while a <year> study keeps them as basal <unk>
within <unk> yates and warren erected two major clades <unk> and <unk>
<unk> include large <unk> <unk> like <unk> with flat heads and eyes near the back of the skull
<unk> include a diversity of <unk> including large marine <unk> aquatic <unk> <unk> that survived into the cretaceous and <unk> with eyes near the front of their heads
in <year> paleontologists rainer <unk> and andrew milner named a third major clade of <unk> the <unk>
this group included more primitive <unk> that could not be placed in either <unk> or <unk> and included groups like <unk> <unk> and <unk>
while <unk> and <unk> are still widely used <unk> is not often supported as a true clade in recent analyses
<unk> and <unk> are now grouped with <unk> but <unk> are still considered to be a primitive family of <unk>
a new phylogeny of <unk> was offered by paleontologist rainer <unk> in <year>
it supported many of the clades that were found by yates and warren but it did not find support for their division of derived <unk> into <unk> and <unk>
<unk> were found to be more closely related to <unk> than to <unk> which were grouped with <unk>
the clade including <unk> and <unk> was named <unk>
in addition <unk> named the clade containing all <unk> except <unk> <unk> and reinstated the name <unk> for the clade containing all <unk> except <unk> and <unk>
<unk> appear to have arisen in the <unk>
molecular clock estimates place the first <unk> in the late carboniferous but the first member of <unk> frogs and <unk> but not <unk> is estimated to have appeared in the middle <unk> using the same technique
using fossil evidence there are three main theories for the origin of modern amphibians
one is that they evolved from <unk> <unk>
another is that they evolved from <unk> most likely the <unk>
a third hypothesis is that <unk> descended from <unk> and frogs and <unk> evolved from <unk>
recently the theory that <unk> were the ancestors of all <unk> has gained wide support
the skull morphology of some small <unk> has been compared to those of modern frogs and <unk> but the presence of <unk> <unk> teeth in small <unk> or immature <unk> has been cited as the most convincing argument in favor of the <unk> origin of <unk>
seen in <unk> and many <unk> <unk> <unk> teeth have <unk> tips and bases
during the development of most <unk> teeth begin to <unk> at their tips
<unk> normally proceeds downward to the base of the tooth but <unk> from the tip stops abruptly in <unk> teeth
<unk> resumes at the base leaving an area in the center of the tooth <unk>
this pattern is seen in living amphibians and fossils
the <unk> family <unk> is thought to be most closely related to <unk>
in <year> an <unk> called <unk> <unk> was named from texas and was nicknamed the <unk> for its frog @-@ like head and salamander @-@ like body
it was thought to be the most closely related <unk> to <unk> and was placed as the sister taxon of the group in a phylogenetic analysis
another species of <unk> called <unk> annectens is now thought to be even more closely related to <unk>
unlike <unk> <unk> was known since <year> and the presence of <unk> teeth in its jaws has led some paleontologists to conclude soon after its naming that it was a relative of modern amphibians
it was first described as a <unk> and the specific name annectens means connecting in reference to its inferred transitional position between <unk> and <unk>
the structure of its tympanum a disk @-@ like membrane that functions like an ear drum is similar to that of frogs and has also been used as evidence for a close relationship
other features including the shape of the palate and the back of the skull the short ribs and the smooth skull surface also point to it being a closer relative of <unk> than is <unk>
later <unk> and <unk> some well adapted to terrestrial life also fed on land
some <unk> became better adapted toward life in water and shifted their diets toward aquatic organisms
the first primarily aquatic feeders were <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> and <unk> became independently aquatic and also returned to this type of feeding
most aquatic <unk> have flattened heads
when feeding they probably opened their mouths by lifting their skulls instead of lowering their lower jaws
the jaw mechanics of the <unk> <unk> is well known and is one of the most highly adapted
<unk> is thought to have lifted its skull to around <num> ° above horizontal through the <unk> of the <unk> @-@ occipital joint between the occipital <unk> of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck
as the skull is raised the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to <unk> outward
other <unk> probably also lifted their skulls but they are not as well adapted for such movement
d
m
s
watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in <unk>
he envisioned that <unk> a much larger <unk> than <unk> was able to make the same movement
paleontologist a
l
<unk> also supported the idea in <year> suggesting that <unk> also fed in this way
at the time it was thought that these <unk> lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle
<unk> a close relative of <unk> also has a <unk> skeleton that muscles may have attached to
<unk> has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth
unlike <unk> <unk> terrestrial <unk> have skulls that are adapted for biting land @-@ living prey
the sutures between the bones of the skull in the <unk> <unk> are able to withstand a high degree of compression
compressive forces would have been experienced when biting down on prey
earlier aquatic <unk> and <unk> ancestors differ from <unk> like <unk> in that their skulls were also built to withstand tension
this tension would have been experienced during suction feeding underwater
<unk> like <unk> were among the first <unk> that were almost exclusively terrestrial and fed by biting
most <unk> probably reproduced through external fertilization
like most living frogs female <unk> would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to <unk> them
several fossils were described from the early <unk> of texas in <year> that may be egg masses of <unk> <unk>
they were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs
the fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably <unk> membranes and halo @-@ like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings
they are attached to plant fossils suggesting that these <unk> laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs
the mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians not fish their eggs lack mucous but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs
the eggs are thought to be from <unk> because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians and probably had similar reproductive strategies
they are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found
one <unk> the <unk> <unk> may have <unk> young in an area between the gills called the <unk> pouch
small bones belonging to younger <unk> individuals have been found in these pouches
the living darwin 's frog is also a mouth brooder and would be the closest modern analogue to <unk> if it cared for its young in this way
an alternative possibility is that <unk> was cannibalistic eating its young like many amphibians do today
if this was the case the bones of these smaller individuals were originally located in the throat and were pushed into the <unk> pouch as the animal fossilized
body impressions of early carboniferous <unk> from pennsylvania suggest that some terrestrial <unk> mated on land like some modern amphibians
they reproduced through internal fertilization rather than mating in water
the presence of three individuals in one block of sandstone shows that the <unk> were gregarious
the head of one individual rests under the tail of another in what may be a courtship display
internal fertilization and similar courtship behavior are seen in modern <unk>
metamorphosis is seen in <unk> <unk> and <unk> with aquatic larvae developing into adults capable of living on land
several types of <unk> do not fully <unk> but retain features of juveniles such as gills and small body size in what is known as <unk>
<unk> and the <unk> <unk> were also <unk> because they retained gills but they are only known from adult specimens
<unk> larvae are often distinguished by poorly developed bones and the presence of a <unk> apparatus a series of bones that gills would attach to in life
however some fully mature <unk> also possess <unk> bones but did not have external gills
a dense covering of scales is also seen in larvae and adults
major body changes occur in metamorphosis including the <unk> and strengthening of skull bones the thickening of postcranial bones and an increase in body size
<unk> like <unk> are known from both large adult specimens and small larvae showing an extreme change in body shape
in these species the shape and proportions of skull bones change in the early stages of development
the ornamentation on the surface of the skull roof also develops at this time
small regularly spaced pits are the first to form followed by larger ridges
as development continues the external gills disappear
small teeth that once covered the palate are lost
the postcranial skeleton does not develop at the same rate as the skull with ossification the replacement of cartilage by bone happening more slowly
vertebrae and limb bones are poorly developed ribs and fingers are absent in the early stages and the <unk> and ischium are entirely absent through most of development
once maturity is reached most bones have fully formed and growth rate slows
the bones of some <unk> like <unk> show growth marks possibly an indication that growth rate varied with the change in seasons
fossils of <unk> like <unk> and <unk> show that individuals grew larger past maturity
the oldest individuals usually have more pitting on their skulls with deeper <unk>
one group of <unk> the <unk> is also known from larval specimens
<unk> like <unk> and <unk> are represented by many fossils preserving skin and external gills
an entire growth series is exhibited in the wide range of sizes among specimens but the lack of <unk> adapted adult forms suggests that these <unk> were <unk>
unlike other <unk> their postcranial skeletons developed quickly but were still partly cartilaginous when fully mature
adults likely had an aquatic lifestyle similar to juveniles
recently large specimens of <unk> gracilis were described with adaptations toward a terrestrial lifestyle indicating that not all <unk> were <unk>
while most <unk> are aquatic in early stages of life most <unk> appear to have been terrestrial in their juvenile stage
like other <unk> <unk> adult <unk> were adapted to a <unk> lifestyle
their bones are not highly developed for movement on land
the cross @-@ <unk> thickness of limb bones in adult <unk> shows that they could not withstand the stress of terrestrial locomotion
juvenile individuals have bones that are thick enough to withstand this stress and could probably move about on land
to maintain a terrestrial lifestyle a <unk> 's limb bones would have to <unk> with positive <unk> meaning that they would grow at a greater rate than the rest of the body
this is not the case in <unk> meaning that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a terrestrial lifestyle
in life the <unk> notch would have been covered by a membrane called the tympanum which is seen as a disk @-@ like area in living frogs
the tympanum is involved in hearing and is similar to the ear drum of more advanced <unk>
it was traditionally thought that the tympanum developed very early in <unk> evolution as a hearing organ and progressed to form the ear drum of <unk>
thus <unk> possessed a hearing system supposedly ancestral to that of living amphibians and reptiles
frogs and all other living <unk> have a rod @-@ like bone called the stapes that aids in hearing by transferring <unk> from the ear drum — or homologous tympanum — to the inner ear
<unk> also have a stapes which projects into the <unk> cavity
the stapes likely evolved from the <unk> of lobe @-@ <unk> fishes
the positioning of the stapes and the shape of the <unk> region suggests that the <unk> of <unk> and frogs are homologous but the <unk> of these amphibians are no longer considered homologous with the hearing systems of reptiles birds and mammals
therefore ear structures in <unk> were not ancestral to those of all other <unk>
the ability of the tympanum and stapes to effectively transmit <unk> is called impedance matching
early <unk> like <unk> have thick stapes with poor impedance matching so it is now thought that they were not used for hearing
instead these thick stapes may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the <unk> notch
early <unk> like <unk> could not hear airborne sound but would have been able to detect vibration in the ground
later <unk> like <unk> had <unk> regions adapted to hearing
<unk> has a structure in the inner ear called the <unk> <unk> which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing
its stapes is also a better transmitter of sound
the hearing system of <unk> and related <unk> was able to detect airborne sound and may have been ancestral to that of living amphibians
a relative of <unk> the archbishop of york osbert probably owed his ecclesiastical positions to this relative
after <unk> 's death osbert was opposed to one of the candidates for the archbishopric william <unk> and worked to secure <unk> 's deposition and replacement by henry <unk>
after <unk> 's death in <num> osbert tried to prevent the return of <unk> but these attempts were unsuccessful
when <unk> died suddenly in <num> osbert was accused of murdering the newly returned archbishop
although he was never convicted of the murder in either a secular or an ecclesiastical court he was stripped of his clerical status and became a <unk> before <num>
he died after <num> perhaps even after <num>
this document lists him as osbert archdeacon which means that he probably held the archdeaconry of richmond
he was the nephew of <unk> who was archbishop of york from <num> to <num>
presumably he owed his position as archdeacon to his uncle and was probably appointed at a young age
a charter of <unk> 's dating to around <num> names osbert explicitly as <unk> 's nephew
although he remained a supporter of <unk> after <num> he did oppose <unk> 's interventions in <unk> abbey where <unk> had deposed one abbot and appointed another
in <num> osbert deposed <unk> 's choice as abbot of <unk> and appointed another abbot
originally osbert had supported elias <unk> <unk> 's choice for abbot but then changed his stance and helped with the deposition
after <unk> 's death in <num> osbert was opposed to william 's return as archbishop but was unsuccessful in his attempts to prevent william 's reappointment
william died a week after his return to york however and osbert along with robert of <unk> the dean of york secured the quick election of the new archbishop roger de pont l <unk>
a fellow cleric symphorian who had been a <unk> of the deceased archbishop brought murder charges against osbert
symphorian obtained a hearing on the charges at a royal council presided over by king stephen of england at <unk> in <num> but stephen 's subsequent death prevented a resolution
osbert attempted to have the trial switched to an ecclesiastical court and was supported in his efforts by archbishop theobald of canterbury
a trial was finally held in <num> and osbert 's <unk> did not produce any witnesses but osbert was unable to prove his innocence prompting the transfer of the case to a papal court
no record of any judgment exists but osbert apparently appeared before two popes adrian iv and alexander iii
a further appeal to the papal court was referred to papal judges @-@ delegate between <num> and <num>
the case attracted commentary by two contemporary writers
john of salisbury who was a secretary for theobald added information about osbert in a letter to alexander iii on unrelated business
in the section of the letter john pointed out to the pope that no matter what others might say about osbert he had failed to secure other clergy willing to <unk> that he was innocent
another contemporary gilbert foliot who was bishop of hereford wrote to the pope to remind him that although osbert 's <unk> had offered to prove his accusations by undergoing a trial by ordeal this was essentially meaningless since canon law forbade the clergy from the ordeal
osbert however continued to call himself archdeacon even though he held land as a secular lord including lands in lacy and <unk>
he also acted as a steward for hugh de tilly
osbert was still alive in <num> as he was a witness to a document at york then and may have been alive as late as <num> when hugh <unk> was responsible for the farm of osbert 's lands as the record of that transaction in the <unk> roll is unclear if osbert was alive at that time or dead
osbert had two sons william de bayeux and <unk> de <unk>
osbert was a benefactor to a number of monasteries including drax priory <unk> priory and <unk> priory
he also gave land to a hospital in york and to the templars and hospitallers
within the dvorak satellite strength estimate for tropical cyclones there are several visual patterns that a cyclone may take on which define the upper and lower bounds on its intensity
the primary patterns used are curved band pattern t1
<num> @-@ <unk>
<num> shear pattern t1
<num> @-@ <unk>
<num> central dense overcast cdo pattern t2
<num> @-@ <unk>
<num> central cold cover ccc pattern banding eye pattern <unk>
<num> @-@ <unk>
<num> and eye pattern <unk>
<num> <unk>
<num>
both the central dense overcast and embedded eye pattern use the size of the cdo
the cdo pattern <unk> start at t2
<num> equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity <num> mph <num> km h
the shape of the central dense overcast is also considered
the eye pattern utilizes the coldness of the cloud tops within the surrounding mass of thunderstorms and contrasts it with the temperature within the eye itself
the larger the temperature difference is the stronger the tropical cyclone
once a pattern is identified the storm features such as length and curvature of banding features are further analyzed to arrive at a particular t @-@ number
the ccc pattern indicates little development is occurring despite the cold cloud tops associated with the quickly evolving feature
several agencies issue dvorak intensity numbers for tropical cyclones and their precursors including the national hurricane center 's tropical analysis and forecast branch <unk> the <unk> <unk> satellite analysis branch <unk> and the joint typhoon warning center at the naval meteorology and oceanography command in pearl harbor hawaii
the system as it was initially conceived involved pattern matching of cloud features with a development and decay model
as the technique matured through the <num> and <num> measurement of cloud features became dominant in defining tropical cyclone intensity and central pressure of the tropical cyclone 's low @-@ pressure area
use of infrared satellite imagery led to a more objective assessment of the strength of tropical cyclones with eyes using the cloud top temperatures within the eyewall and contrasting them with the warm temperatures within the eye itself
constraints on short term intensity change are used less frequently than they were back in the <num> and <num>
the central pressures assigned to tropical cyclones have required modification as the original estimates were <num> @-@ <num> hpa <num>
<num> @-@ <num>
<num> inhg too low in the atlantic and up to <num> hpa <num>
<num> inhg too high in the northwest pacific
this led to the development of a separate wind @-@ pressure relationship for the northwest pacific devised by atkinson and holliday in <year> then modified in <year>
as human analysts using the technique lead to <unk> biases efforts have been made to make more objective estimates using computer programs which have been aided by higher @-@ resolution satellite imagery and more powerful computers
since tropical cyclone satellite patterns can fluctuate over time automated techniques use a six @-@ hour averaging period to lead to more reliable intensity estimates
development of the objective dvorak technique began in <year> which performed best with tropical cyclones that had eyes of hurricane or typhoon strength
it still required a manual center placement keeping some subjectivity within the process
by <year> an advanced objective dvorak technique was developed which utilized banding features for systems below hurricane intensity and to objectively determine the tropical cyclone 's center
a central pressure bias was uncovered in <year> relating to the slope of the <unk> and cloud top temperatures which change with latitude that helped improve central pressure estimates within the objective technique
the structure and organization of the tropical cyclone are tracked over <num> hours to determine if the storm has weakened maintained its intensity or strengthened
various central cloud and banding features are compared with <unk> that show typical storm patterns and their associated intensity
if infrared satellite imagery is available for a cyclone with a visible eye pattern then the technique utilizes the difference between the temperature of the warm eye and the surrounding cold cloud tops to determine intensity colder cloud tops generally indicate a more intense storm
in each case a t @-@ number an abbreviation for tropical number and a current intensity ci value are assigned to the storm
these measurements range between <num> minimum intensity and <num> maximum intensity
the t @-@ number and ci value are the same except for weakening storms in which case the ci is higher
for weakening systems the ci is held as the tropical cyclone intensity for <num> hours though research from the national hurricane center indicates that six hours is more reasonable
the table at right shows the approximate surface wind speed and sea level pressure that corresponds to a given t @-@ number
the amount a tropical cyclone can change in strength per <num> ‑ hour period is limited to <num>
<num> t @-@ numbers per day
the primary patterns used are curved band pattern t1
<num> @-@ <unk>
<num> shear pattern t1
<num> @-@ <unk>
<num> central dense overcast cdo pattern t2
<num> @-@ <unk>
<num> banding eye pattern <unk>
<num> @-@ <unk>
<num> eye pattern <unk>
<num> <unk>
<num> and central cold cover ccc pattern
both the central dense overcast and embedded eye pattern utilize the size of the cdo
the cdo pattern <unk> start at t2
<num> equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity <num> miles per hour <num> km h
the shape of the central dense overcast is also considered
the farther the center is tucked into the cdo the stronger it is deemed
tropical cyclones with maximum sustained winds between <num> miles per hour <num> km h and <num> miles per hour <num> km h can have their center of <unk> obscured by cloudiness within visible and infrared satellite imagery which makes diagnosis of their intensity a challenge
the ccc pattern with its large and quickly developing mass of thick cirrus clouds spreading out from an area of convection near a tropical cyclone center within a short time frame indicates little development
when it develops rainbands and cloud lines around the tropical cyclone weaken and the thick cloud shield <unk> the circulation center
while it resembles a cdo pattern it is rarely seen
the eye pattern utilizes the coldness of the cloud tops within the surrounding mass of thunderstorms and contrasts it with the temperature within the eye itself
the larger the temperature difference is the stronger the tropical cyclone
winds within tropical cyclones can also be estimated by tracking features within the cdo using rapid scan <unk> satellite imagery whose pictures are taken minutes apart rather than every half @-@ hour
once a pattern is identified the storm features such as length and curvature of banding features are further analyzed to arrive at a particular t @-@ number
these include the national hurricane center 's tropical analysis and forecast branch <unk> the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 's satellite analysis branch <unk> and the joint typhoon warning center at the naval pacific meteorology and oceanography center in pearl harbor hawaii
the national hurricane center will often quote dvorak t @-@ numbers in their tropical cyclone products
the following example is from discussion number <num> of tropical depression <num> eventually hurricane wilma of the <year> atlantic hurricane season both <unk> and <unk> came in with a dvorak satellite intensity estimate of t2
<num> <num> <unk>
however
oftentimes the surface wind field of large developing low pressure systems like this one will lag about <num> hours behind the satellite signature
therefore
the initial intensity has only been increased to <num> <unk>
note that in this case the dvorak t @-@ number in this case t2
<num> was simply used as a guide but other factors determined how the nhc decided to set the system 's intensity
the cooperative institute for meteorological satellite studies <unk> at the university of wisconsin – madison has developed the objective dvorak technique <unk>
this is a modified version of the dvorak technique which uses computer algorithms rather than <unk> human interpretation to arrive at a ci number
this is generally not implemented for tropical depressions or weak tropical storms
the china meteorological agency <unk> is expected to start using the standard <year> version of dvorak in the near future
the indian meteorological department <unk> prefers using visible satellite imagery over infrared imagery due to a perceived high bias in estimates derived from infrared imagery during the early morning hours of convective maximum
the japan meteorological agency jma uses the infrared version of dvorak over the visible imagery version
hong kong observatory and jma continue to utilize dvorak after tropical cyclone landfall
various centers hold on to the maximum current intensity for <num> – <num> hours though this rule is broken when rapid weakening is obvious
citizen science site cyclone center uses a modified version of the dvorak technique to categorize post @-@ <year> tropical weather
intensity estimates of maximum sustained wind are currently within <num> miles per hour <num>
<num> km h of what aircraft are able to measure half of the time though the assignment of intensity of systems with strengths between moderate tropical @-@ storm force <num> miles per hour <num> km h and weak <unk> or typhoon @-@ force <num> miles per hour <num> km h is the least certain
its overall precision has not always been true as refinements in the technique led to intensity changes between <year> and <year> of up to <num> miles per hour <num> km h
the method is internally consistent in that it <unk> rapid increases or decreases in tropical cyclone intensity
some tropical cyclones fluctuate in strength more than the <num>
<num> t numbers per day limit allowed by the rule which can work to the technique 's disadvantage and has led to occasional abandonment of the constraints since the <num>
systems with small eyes near the limb or edge of a satellite image can be biased too weakly using the technique which can be resolved through use of polar @-@ orbiting satellite imagery
subtropical cyclone intensity cannot be determined using dvorak which led to the development of the hebert @-@ <unk> technique in <year>
cyclones undergoing extratropical transition losing their thunderstorm activity see their <unk> underestimated using the dvorak technique
this led to the development of the miller and lander extratropical transition technique which can be used under these circumstances
it served as a connector between ny <num> its parent route in the cayuga county village of <unk> and ny <num> in the onondaga county town of elbridge
ny 31b was assigned c

after a short distance the highway went through an isolated area of homes where it intersected with cr <num> and cr <unk>
ny 31b continued on intersecting several local highways before crossing into onondaga county and terminating at an intersection with ny <num> in the town of elbridge
ny <num> was renumbered to ny 31b c

central australian artists frequently paint particular <unk> or stories for which they have responsibility or rights
these stories are used to pass important knowledge cultural values and belief systems from generation to generation
paintings by <unk> portray two different groups of <unk> rendered in two distinct styles
bush plum dreaming represents a plant of the central australian desert which is a source of physical and spiritual sustenance reminding the local indigenous people of the <unk> of their country
these paintings are undertaken with red blue and orange dots that represent the fruit at different stages in its development
she also paints women ’ s ceremonies <unk> and <unk> and these are created using rows of coloured dots and include representations of women 's ceremonial iconography

her style is described by indigenous art writers <unk> and <unk> as an interesting modern interpretation of landscape
<unk> 's work is held in a variety of public and private collections including <unk> the charles sturt university collection the holmes a court collection and the national gallery of victoria
it shows a bust view of a single figure modeled on diego <unk> 's portrait of innocent x
bacon applies forceful expressive brush <unk> and places the figure within a glass cage structure behind curtain @-@ like drapery
this gives the effect of a man trapped and <unk> by his surroundings screaming into an <unk> void
head vi was the first of bacon 's paintings to reference <unk> whose portrait of pope innocent x haunted him throughout his career and inspired his series of screaming popes a loose series of which there are around <num> surviving individual works
head vi contains many motifs that were to reappear in bacon 's work
the hanging object which may be a light switch or curtain <unk> can be found even in his late paintings
the geometric cage is a motif that appears as late as his <year> – <num> masterpiece study for a self @-@ portrait — triptych
head vi was first exhibited in november <year> at the hanover gallery in london in a showing organised by one of the artist 's early champions erica <unk>
at the time bacon was a highly controversial but respected artist best known for his <year> three studies for figures at the base of a crucifixion which made him the <unk> terrible of british art
head vi drew a mixed reaction from art critics john russell later bacon 's biographer at the time dismissed it as a cross between an alligator shorn of its jaws and an accountant in <unk> @-@ <unk> who has come to a bad end
in <year> lawrence <unk> wrote that the shock of the picture when it was seen with a whole series of heads
was indescribable
it was everything <unk>
the paradoxical appearance at once of pastiche and iconoclasm was indeed one of bacon 's most original <unk>
art critic and curator david sylvester described it as a seminal piece from bacon 's unusually productive <year> – <num> period and one of bacon 's finest popes
he told sylvester that his imagination was stimulated by sequences and that images breed other images in me
his series were not always planned or painted in sequence sometimes paintings are grouped for convenience but vary in execution and tone
the idea for the head series came after he returned penniless late in <year> from a stay in <unk>
in the previous three years he had been unable to find a voice the last surviving canvas from this period is his painting <year>
although he continued to paint he was a ruthless self critic given to slashing canvases with blades and no works survive from between <year> and the winter of <year>
<unk> erica <unk> offered bacon the opportunity of a solo show for the opening of her new hanover gallery
he agreed but had nothing in reserve to hang
in following years <unk> became perhaps the most important of bacon 's early champions she arranged this showing — his debut solo exhibition — publicised him widely and organised <unk> for international buyers
already <num> years old bacon viewed the exhibition as his last chance and applied himself to the task with determination
because he had destroyed all his out of the last three years he had little choice but to present new works
he did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show but eventually found themes that interested him in his head i of the previous year and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the november exhibition completing the series barely in time for the opening
the paintings depict isolated figures enclosed in spaces that are <unk> overwhelmingly claustrophobic <unk> and eerie
coming early in bacon 's career they are uneven in quality but show a clear progression especially in how they utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with
head i actually begun in the winter of <year> and head ii show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads they have half @-@ open eyes and a pharynx though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human
heads iii iv and v show fully formed busts recognisable as men and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere
these two broad ideas <unk> in head vi which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings and as spectral as the middle three
in head vi the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments the first indication in bacon 's work of the influence of <unk> while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream
bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge
this was especially the case in the mid to late <num> a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in soho casinos and poker rooms
the following morning he would often approach his canvas in a bad mood of drinking
under tremendous <unk> and drink i sometimes hardly knew what i was doing
he incorporated his appetite for chance into his work an image often would morph mid @-@ way through into something quite different from what he had first intended
he actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist
to him lifestyle and art were intertwined he said that perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer
this is very evident in the <year> series which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of <unk> masterpieces and arrived at an image that was to <unk> bacon for the subsequent <num> years
the series marks bacon 's first attempt at depicting lone figures in rooms
for him the key aspect was that it appeared that the subject felt isolated <unk> and had abandoned the need to present an outward face
he believed that under these circumstances all pretence falls away and the social being becomes the sum of its <unk> which bacon attempted to convey by reducing the subject to its bare @-@ bones features a mouth ears eyes a jaw
according to russell the view out front ceases to be the only one and our person is suddenly adrift fragmented and subject to strange mutation
russell observed that while the depiction of figures in rooms is common through all eras of painting the figures are always posed and usually seemingly aware that they are being portrayed
this conceit is abandoned in bacon 's series
head i completed late in <year> is considered more successful than head ii
although it is well @-@ regarded critically head ii is seen as something of a creative cul @-@ de @-@ sac while heads iii iv and v are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards head vi
it is exceptional in bacon 's oeuvre that works of their relative poor quality survive he was <unk> self @-@ critical and often slashed or abandoned <unk> before they were completed
when pressed again by <unk> in <year> to produce works for a new york show that she had been publicising for a year he was full of doubt and destroyed most of what he had been working on including several other popes
<unk> commissioned another showing to be held in <year> for which bacon painted three large popes modelled on <unk> 's portrait
the gallery advertised the show as francis bacon three studies from the painting of innocent x by <unk> but in the end bacon was dissatisfied with the works and destroyed them before the show opened
it seems trapped and isolated within the outlines of an abstract three @-@ dimensional glass cage
this framing device described by sylvester as a space @-@ frame was to feature heavily throughout the artist 's career
a cord hangs from the upper edge of the glass case falling just in front of the pope 's face and partially covering his eyes
it is too <unk> drawn to identify with certainty but given the presence of similar objects in bacon 's later works may be either the end of a hanging light switch or the <unk> of a curtain the hanging cord was to become a signature for the artist
apart from its symbolic meaning it has a <unk> function framing the painting with a further set of vertical lines
such an object reappears most prominently in the centre panel of his <year> triptych may – june <year> where it is clearly a dangling light bulb
for bacon these elements were intended to make the figure waver in and out of sight for the viewer alluding to the fact that bulbs can be on or off curtains open or closed
the figure 's mouth is opened wide as if screaming an expression bacon took from a still he kept of the nurse screaming in sergei <unk> 's odessa steps massacre sequence in his <year> silent film battleship <unk>
in <year> the broadcaster melvyn bragg asked bacon about the still and observed that in his earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the physicality of the human mouth
bacon replied i had always thought that i would be able to make the mouth with all the beauty of a <unk> landscape though i never succeeded in doing so
when bragg asked why he thought he had failed bacon said it should be all much more colour should have got more of the interior of the mouth with all the colours of the interior of the mouth but i didn 't happen to get it
his interest in the mouth was further stimulated by a medical textbook of <unk> oral cavities bought in a second @-@ hand bookshop kept in his studio and to which he often referred to
the glass cage might imply a vacuum that the figure 's voice is unable to escape as if it is screaming in silence
rueful later in life bacon said that he had wanted to paint the scream more than the horror
i think if i had really thought about what causes somebody to really scream it would have made the scream
more successful
the work evokes memories of the second world war
the glass enclosure of his <year> chicago study for a portrait is often seen as <unk> photographs of adolf <unk> <year> trial before a jerusalem district court when he was held within a similar cage
bacon strongly resisted literal comparisons though and stated that he used the device so he could frame and really see the image – for no other reason
i know it 's been interpreted as being many other things
other critics saw similarities between the glass case and the radio booths of late <num> broadcasters who warned against the impending calamity
denis farr notes that bacon was sympathetic to george orwell and referred in interviews to <unk> shouting voices
and trembling hands
convey ing the harsh atmosphere of an <unk>
however <unk> had by <year> used it only in surrealist contexts before bacon 's <unk> and in turn influenced his use in the cage of <year>
a similar two dimensional construct is found in henry moore 's works notably his <unk> for king and queen constructed three years after bacon 's head
it is difficult to <unk> how these artists influenced and informed each other
what is notable is that bacon continued to use the motif with intervals until the end of his life
sylvester suggests his finest example is the <year> three studies of the male back
the full @-@ length golden curtain @-@ like folds painted in heavy brush <unk> are in part influenced by <unk> but also similar to titian 's <year> portrait of cardinal filippo <unk>
bacon adapts the old master 's device to isolate and distance the sitter from the viewer the black ground @-@ paint is visible through the folds making the separation all the more affecting
bacon had already used similar forms in his chicago panel and they were to become a feature of his most acclaimed <num> works especially in his screaming popes
he became fascinated with the veil or curtain as a motif in painting and collected many reproductions of works by titian and <unk> in which it is employed
he had begun his career as an interior <unk> and designer of furniture and rugs in the mid @-@ <num> and later said that he liked rooms hung all round with just curtains hung in even folds
<unk> or curtains appear in bacon 's earliest works notably the <year> study from the human body always in portraits and always in front of rather than behind the figure
head vi is closely modelled on <unk> 's c
<year> portrait of innocent x today in the <unk> <unk> gallery rome
bacon cautiously avoided seeing the original even when he spent three months in rome in <year>
critics speculate he was afraid of being disappointed or thought that an intimate knowledge of the painting would dull his imagination
yet his fascination was all @-@ consuming and he reproduced variants of it <unk> for almost two decades an examination and homage described as without parallel in the history of art
bacon 's approach differs to <unk> 's in a number of ways both artists were expressive yet bacon 's broad brush @-@ <unk> and freedom with paint contrast with <unk> 's tight and controlled treatment
he adapts <unk> 's positioning of the pope to place him above the viewer 's point of view elevating and distancing him
this was already a common technique in commercial promotional photography but in bacon 's hands <unk> argues the angle places the pope on a kind of stage for the viewer to coldly observe
although bacon revered <unk> 's portrait he did not try and reproduce the earlier painting
in interviews he said that he saw flaws in <unk> 's work and that he viewed that social structure and order as according to art historian <unk> <unk> obsolete and decayed
bacon 's approach was to elevate his subject so he could knock him down again thereby making a sly comment on the treatment of royalty in both old master and contemporary painting
yet <unk> 's influence is apparent in many aspects of the painting
the sitter 's pose closely echoes the original as does the violet and white colouring of his cope which is built up through broad thick brush @-@ <unk>
the influence can be further seen in the gold @-@ coloured ornaments on the back of the seat that extend on both sides of the figure
art historian armin <unk> describes the work as a mixture of reverence and subversion that pays tribute to <unk> while at the same time deconstructs his painting
sylvester <unk> the influence of late works by titian in other aspects especially in the deep and rich colouring <unk> 's portrayals of philip iv and agrees with identification of pastels of edgar <unk> as a source
he believes bacon borrowed from <unk> the use of parallel heavy folds to create the illusion of what <unk> described as shuttering as seen in the earlier artist 's after the bath woman drying herself
sylvester makes a further direct link between the folds and the transparent veil in titian 's portrait of cardinal filippo <unk>
he believes the folds serve to push the viewer back creating a distance from the subject an effect he sees as similar to the separation between and orchestra and setting others view the folds as more closely resembling the bars of a prison
sylvester describes them as an <unk> of background <unk> into stripes that are made to appear as if they pass through the sitter
in his interviews with francis bacon series of books he asked bacon why he found the effect so poignant
the artist replied well it means that the sensation doesn 't come straight out at you but slides slowly and gently through the gaps
when asked why he was compelled to revisit the <unk> so often bacon replied that he had nothing against popes per se but merely sought an excuse to use these colours and you can 't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false <unk> manner
<unk> sees head vi as a reaction against <unk> and a commentary on how the papacy is obsolete and decayed with a pope resistant to both modernisation and <unk>
to him the figure seems to resist the maltreatment of image and tries to halt the impending collapse of the established work order
he screams and <unk> clutching at arms of his throne
sylvester notes that bacon was impressed by picasso 's <unk> and handling of paint especially in picasso 's <num> works and suggests that the white <unk> around the pope 's cape may be influenced by the <year> woman in a slip seated in an armchair
he had success in <year> with three studies for figures at the base of a crucifixion and to a lesser extent with painting <year> both of which were highly regarded but viewed as sensationalist
the exhibition was a success and marked his critical breakthrough
until then he had been highly regarded but capable of only occasional brilliance
the full show established him in the minds of critics as according to michael <unk> more of a force to be reckoned with in the contemporary scene
while some found his images horrifying and <unk> they wrote about him all the same sealing his reputation as the <unk> terrible of post @-@ war british art
the critic for the observer wrote the recent paintings
horrifying as they are cannot be ignored
technically they are superb and the masterly handling of large areas of <unk> grey flushed with a sudden pink or green only makes me regret the more that the artist 's gift should have been brought to subjects so esoteric
most critics focused on heads i and vi remarking favourably on the progression between the two
while some found the inherent violence of the paintings <unk> <unk> was a skilled publicist and turned the bad press into notoriety and brought bacon 's work to national attention
<unk> notes that the exhibition showed bacon no longer needed sensationalist material to make an impact and was now capable of creating an intense emotional response through more subtle means and had found a way of presenting the human condition in the way he had sought by presenting his sitter in a vestigial setting a cage or behind a parted <unk>
the rest the most essential lay in the manipulation of the infinitely suggestive medium of oil paint
after the showing bacon gradually became less the outsider with an occasional image of horrifying brilliance and more a force to be reckoned with on the contemporary scene
his reputation and the value of his panels rose dramatically and after the showing he was sought after by european american and african collectors and galleries commanding prices as high as £ <num> for single works unusual for a contemporary british artist of the time
it was acquired by the arts council 's <unk> gallery in <year>
the <unk> has loaned it out a number of times since including for major retrospectives at the grand palais paris in <year> and the hugh lane gallery dublin in <year>
in may <year> the national gallery took on loan <unk> 's innocent x portrait and hung it alongside four bacon paintings head vi pope i <year> pope <year> and pope <year>
<unk> believes that bacon would have disapproved of such a showing with a work he considered one of the finest ever painted but writes that two including head vi stood up to it and even enhanced its authority as one of the most penetrating studies of human nature and human power
<unk> has been described as the most influential movement in english poetry since the activity of the pre @-@ raphaelites
as a poetic style it gave modernism its start in the early <num> century and is considered to be the first organized modernist literary movement in the english language
<unk> is sometimes viewed as a succession of creative moments rather than any continuous or sustained period of development
rené <unk> remarked that it is more accurate to consider <unk> not as a doctrine nor even as a poetic school but as the association of a few poets who were for a certain time in agreement on a small number of important principles
the <unk> rejected the sentiment and <unk> typical of much romantic and victorian poetry in contrast to their contemporaries the georgian poets who were generally content to work within that tradition
in contrast <unk> called for a return to what were seen as more classical values such as directness of presentation and economy of language as well as a willingness to experiment with non @-@ traditional verse forms
<unk> use free verse
imagist publications appearing between <year> and <year> featured works by many of the most prominent modernist figures both in poetry and in other fields
the imagist group was centered in london with members from great britain ireland and the united states
somewhat unusually for the time a number of women writers were major imagist figures
a characteristic feature of <unk> is its attempt to isolate a single image to reveal its essence
this feature mirrors contemporary developments in avant @-@ garde art especially <unk>
although <unk> isolates objects through the use of what ezra pound called luminous details pound 's <unk> method of juxtaposing concrete instances to express an <unk> is similar to <unk> 's manner of synthesizing multiple perspectives into a single image
they continued to work in this vein into the early years of the <num> century
as the new century opened austin was still the serving british poet laureate a post which he held up to <year>
in the century 's first decade poetry still had a large audience volumes of verse published in that time included thomas hardy 's the <unk> christina rossetti 's posthumous poetical works ernest <unk> 's poems george meredith 's last poems robert service 's ballads of a <unk> and john masefield 's ballads and poems
future nobel prize winner william butler yeats was devoting much of his energy to the abbey theatre and writing for the stage producing relatively little lyric poetry during this period
in <year> the nobel prize for literature was awarded to <unk> kipling
the origins of <unk> are to be found in two poems autumn and a city sunset by t
e
hulme
these were published in january <year> by the poets club in london in a booklet called for christmas <unk>
hulme was a student of mathematics and philosophy he had been involved in the setting up of the club in <year> and was its first secretary
around the end of <year> he presented his paper a lecture on modern poetry at one of the club 's meetings
writing in a
r
<unk> 's magazine the new age the poet and critic f
s
flint a champion of free verse and modern french poetry was highly critical of the club and its publications
from the ensuing debate hulme and flint became close friends
in <year> hulme left the poets club and started meeting with flint and other poets in a new group which hulme referred to as the secession club they met at the eiffel tower restaurant in london 's soho to discuss plans to reform contemporary poetry through free verse and the <unk> and haiku and the removal of all unnecessary <unk> from poems
the interest in japanese verse forms can be placed in a context of the late victorian and edwardian revival of interest in <unk> and <unk> as witnessed in the <num> vogue for william anderson 's japanese prints donated to the british museum performances of noh plays in london and the success of gilbert and sullivan 's <unk> the <unk> <year>
direct literary models were available from a number of sources including f
v
<unk> 's <year> <unk> nin is <unk> or stanzas by a century of poets being japanese lyrical odes the first english @-@ language version of the <unk> <unk> a <num> @-@ century anthology of <num> <unk> the early <num> @-@ century critical writings and poems of <unk> hartmann and contemporary french @-@ language translations
the american poet ezra pound was introduced to the group in april <year> and found that their ideas were close to his own
in particular pound 's studies of romantic literature had led him to an admiration of the condensed direct expression that he detected in the writings of <unk> daniel dante and guido <unk> amongst others
for example in his <year> – <num> series of essays i gather the limbs of osiris pound writes of daniel 's line <unk> de <unk> m <unk> <unk> it rests me to think of her from the <unk> en <unk> <unk> 'l <unk> <unk> you cannot get statement simpler than that or clearer or less rhetorical
these criteria of directness clarity and lack of rhetoric were to be amongst the defining qualities of imagist poetry
through his friendship with laurence <unk> pound had already developed an interest in japanese art by examining <unk> @-@ e prints at the british museum and he quickly became absorbed in the study of related japanese verse forms
in an article in la france <year> the french critic <unk> de <unk> described the <unk> as descendants of the french <unk> and in a <year> letter to the french critic and translator rené <unk> pound was keen to emphasise another ancestry for <unk> pointing out that hulme was indebted to a symbolist tradition linking back via william butler yeats arthur symons and the <unk> club generation of british poets to <unk>
and the symbolist source was amplified further in <unk> 's study published in <year> in which he concluded however great the divergence of technique and language between the image of the imagist and the symbol of the <unk> there is a difference only of precision
in <year> pound edited the poetry of another <num> poet lionel johnson for the publisher <unk> mathews
d
and her future husband richard <unk>
these two were interested in exploring greek poetic models especially <unk> an interest that pound shared
the compression of expression that they achieved by following the greek example complemented the proto @-@ imagist interest in japanese poetry and in <year> during a meeting with them in the british museum tea room pound told h
d
and <unk> that they were <unk> and even appended the signature h
d
<unk> to some poems they were discussing
when harriet monroe started her poetry magazine in <year> she had asked pound to act as foreign editor
in october <year> he submitted <unk> three poems each by h
d
and <unk> under the <unk> <unk> published in the november <year> second issue thereof with a note which described <unk> as one of the <unk>
this note along with the appendix note the complete works of t
s
hulme in pound 's book also published in autumn <year> entitled <unk> are considered to be first appearances of the word <unk> later anglicised to <unk> in print
<unk> 's poems <unk> to a greek marble and au vieux <unk> were in the november issue of poetry and h
d
s hermes of the ways <unk> and <unk> appeared in the january <year> issue <unk> as a movement was launched
poetry 's april issue published what came to be seen as <unk> 's enabling text the haiku @-@ like poem of ezra pound entitled in a station of the metro the <unk> of these faces in the crowd <unk> on a wet black bough
the march <year> issue of poetry contained a few don <unk> by an <unk> and the essay entitled <unk> both written by pound with the latter being attributed to flint
the latter contained this <unk> statement of the group 's position direct treatment of the thing whether <unk> or objective
to use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation
as regarding rhythm to compose in sequence of the musical phrase not in sequence of the <unk>
pound 's note opened with a definition of an image as that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time
pound goes on to state it is better to present one image in a lifetime than to produce voluminous works
his list of don <unk> reinforced his three statements in <unk> while warning that they should not be considered as dogma but as the result of long contemplation
taken together these two texts comprised the imagist programme for a return to what they saw as the best poetic practice of the past
f
s
flint commented we have never claimed to have invented the moon
we do not pretend that our ideas are original
the <year> preface to some imagist poets comments <unk> does not merely mean the presentation of pictures
<unk> refers to the manner of presentation not to the subject
d
pound decided to publish an anthology under the title des <unk>
it was first published in alfred <unk> 's little magazine the glebe and was later published in <year> by alfred and charles boni in new york and by harold <unk> at the poetry bookshop in london
it became one of the most important and influential english @-@ language collections of modernist verse
included in the thirty @-@ seven poems were ten poems by <unk> seven by h
d
and six by pound
the book also included work by f
s
flint <unk> <unk> amy lowell william carlos williams james joyce ford <unk> ford allen upward and john <unk>
max michelson was also another included in the important <year> anthology by william pratt the imagist poem modern poetry in miniature
pound 's editorial choices were based on what he saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with imagist precepts rather than active participation in a group as such
williams who was based in the united states had not participated in any of the discussions of the eiffel tower group
however he and pound had long been corresponding on the question of the renewal of poetry along similar lines
ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on pound as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier pre @-@ raphaelite @-@ influenced style towards a harder more modern way of writing
the inclusion of a poem by joyce i hear an army which was sent to pound by w
b
yeats took on a wider importance in the history of literary modernism as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication at pound 's behest of a portrait of the artist as a young man in the <unk>
joyce 's poem is not written in free verse but in rhyming quatrains
however it strongly reflects pound 's interest in poems written to be sung to music such as those by the <unk> and guido <unk>
the book met with little popular or critical success at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do and a number of copies were returned to the publisher
flint was at pains to emphasise the contribution of the eiffel tower poets especially edward storer
pound who believed that the hellenic hardness that he saw as the distinguishing quality of the poems of h
d
and <unk> was likely to be diluted by the <unk> of storer was to play no further direct role in the history of the <unk>
he went on to co @-@ found the <unk> with his friend the painter and writer wyndham lewis
around this time the american imagist amy lowell moved to london determined to promote her own work and that of the other imagist poets
lowell was a wealthy heiress from boston whose brother abbott lawrence lowell was president of harvard university from <year> @-@ <year>
she loved keats and cigars
she was also an enthusiastic champion of literary experiment who was willing to use her money to publish the group
lowell was determined to change the method of selection from pound 's autocratic editorial attitude to a more democratic manner
this new editorial policy was stated in the preface to the first anthology to appear under her leadership in this new book we have followed a slightly different arrangement to that of our former anthology
instead of an arbitrary selection by an editor each poet has been permitted to represent himself by the work he considers his best the only stipulation being that it should not yet have appeared in book form
the outcome was a series of imagist anthologies under the title some imagist poets
the first of these appeared in <year> planned and assembled mainly by h
d
and <unk>
two further issues both edited by lowell were published in <year> and <year>
these three volumes featured most of the original poets also including imagist poetry by the american poet john gould fletcher with the exception of pound who had tried to persuade her to drop the imagist name from her publications and who <unk> dubbed this phase of <unk> amy @-@ <unk>
lowell persuaded d
h
lawrence to contribute poems to the <year> and <year> volumes making him the only writer to publish as both a georgian poet and an imagist
<unk> moore also became associated with the group during this period
however with world war i as a backdrop the times were not easy for avant @-@ garde literary movements <unk> for example spent much of the war at the front and the <year> anthology effectively marked the end of the <unk> as a movement
<unk> by now a successful novelist took up the suggestion and enlisted the help of ford and h
d
the result was the imagist anthology <year> edited by <unk> and including all the contributors to the four earlier anthologies with the exception of lowell who had died <unk> who had disappeared and pound who declined
the appearance of this anthology initiated a critical discussion of the place of the <unk> in the history of <num> @-@ century poetry
of the poets who were published in the various imagist anthologies joyce lawrence and <unk> are now primarily remembered and read as novelists
<unk> moore who was at most a fringe member of the group carved out a unique poetic style of her own that retained an imagist concern with compression of language
william carlos williams developed his poetic along distinctly american lines with his variable foot and a diction he claimed was taken from the mouths of polish mothers
both pound and h
d
turned to writing long poems but retained much of the hard edge to their language as an imagist legacy
most of the other members of the group are largely forgotten outside the context of the history of <unk>
richard <unk> in his <year> memoir writes i think the poems of ezra pound d
h
lawrence and ford <unk> ford will continue to be read
and to a considerable extent t
s
eliot and his followers have carried on their operations from positions won by the <unk>
on the other hand wallace stevens found shortcomings in the imagist approach not all objects are equal
the vice of <unk> was that it did not recognize this
with its demand for hardness clarity and precision and its insistence on fidelity to appearances coupled with its rejection of irrelevant <unk> emotions <unk> had later effects that are <unk> in t
s
eliot 's preludes and morning at the window and in d
h
lawrence 's animal and flower pieces
the rejection of conventional verse forms in the nineteen @-@ twenties owed much to the <unk> repudiation of the georgian poetry style
the influence of <unk> can be seen clearly in the work of the <unk> poets who came to prominence in the <num> under the auspices of pound and williams
the <unk> worked mainly in free verse
clearly linking <unk> 's principles with <unk> 's louis <unk> insisted in his introduction to the <year> <unk> issue of poetry on writing which is the detail not mirage of seeing of thinking with the things as they exist and of directing them along a line of melody
<unk> was a major influence on the language poets who carried the imagist focus on formal concerns to a high level of development
basil bunting another <unk> poet was a key figure in the early development of the british poetry revival a loose movement that also absorbed the influence of the san francisco renaissance poets
<unk> influenced a number of poetry circles and movements
with the <unk> free verse became a discipline and acquired status as a legitimate poetic form
in the <num> especially with the beat generation the black mountain poets and others associated with the san francisco renaissance
in his seminal <year> essay <unk> verse charles olson the theorist of the black mountain group wrote one perception must immediately and directly lead to a further perception his <unk> derived from and supplemented the <unk>
among the beats gary snyder and allen ginsberg in particular were influenced by the imagist emphasis on chinese and japanese poetry
william carlos williams was another who had a strong effect on the beat poets encouraging poets like lew welch and writing an introduction for the book publication of ginsberg 's howl <year>
in late december <year> violence quickly enveloped the city as armed militants began clashing with government soldiers
on <num> january <year> the us ambassador to somalia james <unk> bishop contacted the department of state requesting an evacuation of the embassy which was approved the following day
united states central command began planning and mobilizing forces that evening
the initial plan was to evacuate with a military transport plane through the mogadishu international airport but this was later abandoned
a helicopter evacuation via the uss guam and uss <unk> was the remaining option
on the morning of <num> january a <num> @-@ person marine and navy seal security detail was dispatched from guam aboard two ch @-@ <unk> super stallion helicopters to secure the embassy and prepare for the main evacuation
the two helicopters returned to guam with the first <num> evacuees
throughout the day foreign diplomats and civilians sought refuge at the embassy
four waves of five ch @-@ <num> sea knight helicopters each evacuated the embassy compound shortly after midnight on <num> january
the evacuees were transported to muscat oman where they disembarked on <num> january
in total <num> diplomats and civilians from <num> countries were evacuated including <num> heads of missions eight ambassadors and four <unk> d 'affaires
by <year> what began as civil disobedience evolved into a civil war with several militias organized to overthrow the central government
in july <year> the embassy moved to a new <num> @-@ acre <num> ha compound <num> miles <num>
<num> km from the previous embassy and james k
bishop was appointed as the united states ambassador to somalia
ambassador bishop had significant experience in crisis management at us embassies
in <year> he was at the us embassy in beirut lebanon when the six @-@ day war erupted
about <num> @,@ <num> americans were evacuated in <num> hours bishop was one of <num> diplomats and soldiers that remained in the city
as deputy assistant secretary of state for africa from <year> – <num> bishop chaired several task forces for crises and gained experience in the state department 's operations center as evacuations were carried out during several coups d <unk>
during his previous assignment as ambassador to liberia <year> – <num> bishop was overseeing the voluntary evacuation of embassy staff and civilians as a civil war in liberia spread when he left in march <year>
soon after returning to washington to prepare for his new appointment to somalia he was appointed to a <unk> to deal with the crisis in liberia which included a gradual evacuation of american civilians and a rapid closure of the embassy in august
on <num> august before leaving the us to take up his post in mogadishu ambassador bishop visited united states central command — the military command for the middle east and northeast africa — where he spent most of the day with its commander gen
norman <unk>
ambassador bishop aware of the ongoing strife believed the odds were better than even that we would have to leave mogadishu under less than favorable circumstances
ambassador bishop understood from his past experiences in beirut and liberia the importance of being prepared to deal with emergencies and spent the afternoon working with military experts to review the embassy 's emergencies and evacuation e e plan until he was satisfied
that central command realized that it might have to conduct an evacuation from mogadishu and was prepared to do that
in its analysis of operation eastern exit the center for naval analyses cited the ambassador bishop 's previous experience and clear understanding of his role in the operation as one of the reasons operation eastern exit went so well
hours after ambassador bishop 's visit to central command iraq invaded kuwait
in <year> the us negotiated access to an airport and port in both mogadishu and berbera because of limited access the us had to locations in the persian gulf area maintaining this access was a main interest for the mogadishu embassy to pursue as the us mobilized to intervene in kuwait
an increasing level of criminal violence prompted ambassador bishop to request the voluntary evacuation of dependents e
g
children and spouses of staff and non @-@ essential staff in early december although fighting between the government and the united somali congress a rebel militia remained no less than about <num> miles <num> km away
the voluntary evacuation later became a mandatory evacuation
by <num> december the number of official us personnel in the city was reduced from <num> to <num> around the same time fighting between the government and rebels came within about <num> miles <num> km of mogadishu
on <num> – <num> december diplomats including many stationed in offices elsewhere in the city were collected and housed in the embassy compound except two volunteers who remained in the embassy 's k @-@ <num> residential apartments located across <unk> road from the embassy
the volunteers in the k @-@ <num> building would be needed as look @-@ outs for the embassy compound 's main gate
on the morning of <num> december the defense attaché was nearly killed when his vehicle was sprayed with bullets and that evening a soldier at a roadblock shot the tires of a vehicle carrying another defense official
attempts by the us and other nations diplomats in particular the italian embassy to negotiate a ceasefire for foreigners to leave were unsuccessful
<unk> road became a shooting gallery preventing those in safe @-@ havens outside the embassy from reaching it
on new year 's day the first american civilians began to seek refuge at the embassy
ambassador bishop requested an evacuation of the american community on <num> january indicating that the evacuation could be with the planned italian french or german evacuation efforts but preferred an evacuation by the us military
the state department authorized the evacuation on <num> january and on that day ambassador bishop specifically requested an evacuation by the us military thereby initiating operation eastern exit
ambassador bishop had spent a considerable amount of time discussing contingency plans for evacuation with other diplomatic posts
ultimately ten heads of missions — eight ambassadors and two <unk> d 'affaires — along with their staff sought refuge in the us embassy compound and were evacuated
the first notice that an evacuation of the mogadishu embassy would be needed came on the morning of <num> january when the top naval commander at central command sent a message to his naval operations staff better have <unk> crowd take a look at a <unk> neo of mogadishu time distance to get there from <unk> op area
following the ambassador 's <num> january evacuation request the commander of central command ordered air force aircraft to the region the movement of amphibious ships to mogadishu and requested united states special operations command to prepare for a noncombatant evacuation operation
the initial plan was to evacuate via mogadishu international airport
soon after the evacuation request the united states air force deployed c @-@ <num> transport planes and an ac @-@ <num> for gunfire support to nairobi kenya awaiting clearances to enter somalia and the ability to safely transfer evacuees from the embassy to the airport
however the us and other foreign embassies were unable to contact anyone within the government to obtain clearances
it also became apparent that the rebels had an ineffective command @-@ and @-@ control structure making it impossible to negotiate any ceasefire or guarantee of safe passage
likewise government troops faced a command @-@ and @-@ control problem reports indicated that army units were separating along clan lines in some cases soldiers shot officers of a different clan when given orders they disagreed with
thus it became clear that safe passage to the airport would not be possible
several other nations also had aircraft mobilized to reach mogadishu but faced the same problems of landing and transit of evacuees to the airport
on <num> january several incidents including a couple exchanges of gunfire suggested that the embassy 's security detail was insufficient to hold off armed somalis until the uss guam and uss <unk> arrived with their helicopters and soldiers at that time scheduled to arrive on <num> january
the embassy had just six marine guards whose job was limited to protecting the chancery
ambassador bishop made an urgent request to washington for two platoons of soldiers to parachute into the embassy to defend it until the ships arrived
the request was denied but the ambassador was told that an advance element from the vessels would reach the embassy the following morning
uss guam and uss <unk> began transit from the coast of oman towards mogadishu at <num> <num> <num> <num> oman time on <num> january
the commander of amphibious group two had initially proposed a seven @-@ ship amphibious task group composed of vessels anchored at <unk> island off oman and dubai and including four amphibious ships so that the full range of amphibious capabilities would be available for the operation
however intervention in kuwait seemed imminent and the commander of naval forces at central command did not want to divert that many ships from the persian gulf thus the decision to send two of the closest ships
although the two vessels were selected by mid @-@ afternoon on <num> january the transfer of some personnel from dubai to <unk> caused a delay of eight to ten hours
guam and <unk> carried forces from the <num> marine expeditionary brigade including a detachment of ch @-@ <unk> super stallion helicopters — the largest helicopters operated by the us military — and two squadrons of ch @-@ <num> sea knight helicopters
planning began in earnest as the ships got underway with a combined command center on guam
on the morning of <num> january the task force 's command questioned why they were not given the option of an amphibious landing and requested a tank landing ship be added to the task force the request was denied
a warrant officer who had previously served as a marine security guard at the mogadishu embassy during the mid @-@ <num> was found
despite ambassador bishop 's planning with central command the task force was provided outdated information
the former <unk> told planners that a new embassy had been planned and was under construction several years prior
in fact the new embassy was located further inland and after receiving updated information task force commanders determined that a beach landing requiring troops to fight their way across the city was too risky
initial plans had the ships launch their helicopters at <num> <num> on <num> january
however in response to indications from ambassador bishop that conditions in mogadishu were deteriorating planners considered <num> @,@ <num> @-@ nautical @-@ mile <num> @,@ <num> km <num> @,@ <num> mi and later <num> @-@ nautical @-@ mile <num> @,@ <num> km <num> @,@ <num> mi flights with the ch @-@ <unk> while the ships were still located in the northern arabian sea
the situation in mogadishu stabilized somewhat and the mission was delayed until <num> january
the <num> soldiers selected for the security detail were issued weapons and ammunition
two marine corps <unk> @-@ <num> refueling tankers were mobilized closer to the operation from bahrain to oman to refuel the helicopters en route to mogadishu and the two helicopters transferred from <unk> to guam
they performed two aerial <unk>
during the first refueling a pipe burst on one of the helicopters <unk> soldiers in fuel and nearly forcing a return to the guam problems with the helicopters navigation system also complicated the refueling rendezvous
the helicopters arrived in mogadishu at dawn crossing the coast just south of the harbor at <num> – <num> feet <num>
<num> – <num>
<num> m in altitude on a route that was planned to avoid areas of more intense violence reported in the northern parts of the city
on their arrival in mogadishu the crew of the helicopters were using an outdated <year> map which showed the embassy in an isolated area
furthermore they had been told the embassy could be discerned by its white stucco perimeter wall and golf course
the embassy was in fact surrounded by new development and the crew saw white stucco walls around many buildings in the city
the helicopters were flying too low to spot a strobe light which was placed on the embassy 's water tower the highest point within the embassy compound and the golf course in the embassy compound had a black oil @-@ coated surface — not the familiar green grass that the helicopter crew would recognize
after breaking radio silence their only direct communication with the embassy was <unk> to contact the embassy they were able to discern it and land at <num> <num>
as they arrived a group of about <num> to <num> somalis were attempting to enter the embassy compound via ladders on the wall but scattered as the helicopters arrived
the security detail moved to establish a perimeter around the embassy compound and the air force 's ac @-@ <num> arrived to provide overhead support
ambassador bishop gave the security detail clear instructions on the rules of engagement they could only use deadly force if people came over the embassy compound 's walls with obvious hostile intent
he also identified three zones of defense stating a preference to retreat to the third zone before the use of deadly force the entire embassy compound the chancery joint administrative office <unk> building marine house and the helicopter landing zone <unk> the chancery and <unk> buildings the two <unk> buildings where the evacuees were held ambassador bishop clearly explained his rationale to the security detail which was to avoid any impression that they were intervening in the violence in mogadishu
he feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes got the impression that the us was intervening in the conflict
to this effect he requested the voice of america and bbc broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not interfere in the conflict
the marines who had been <unk> in fuel during the refueling were able to take a shower and wash their clothes
after an hour on the ground the helicopters left with the first <num> evacuees including all american civilians and four heads of mission
evacuees were provided blankets on one of the flights to remain warm
complications with the only in @-@ flight refueling on the return nearly prevented refueling which would have forced the helicopters to divert to the somali desert and await a rescue
at <num> <num> the helicopters arrived on guam and unloaded the evacuees
only one incident seemed to directly target the embassy
a sniper and a spotter were positioned on the embassy 's water tower the highest structure in the compound and came under fire they were ordered to not return fire and soon thereafter ordered to leave their position on the water tower
the office of military cooperation just one and a half blocks from the embassy required evacuation
despite its proximity to the embassy an armed convoy was needed to evacuate persons trapped there by the unrest
a convoy of vehicles with several marines and seals left the embassy at <num> <num> and returned ten minutes later with <num> persons from the <unk> four americans a filipino and <num> <unk>
this was the only excursion outside the embassy by the security detail
throughout the day foreign diplomats contacted the embassy desiring to be evacuated the us welcomed these requests but required all of them to find their own transportation to the embassy
a somali officer who had a previous relationship with the embassy major siad agreed to travel to rescue the german chargé d 'affaires and british ambassador junior staff from the british embassy had previously come to the us embassy
the soviet union was unable to land a plane in mogadishu the previous day and the soviet ambassador asked ambassador bishop if he and his staff could be rescued ambassador bishop a tennis partner of his soviet counterpart agreed but only if they found their own way to the embassy
seeing the helicopters on the morning of <num> january they realized the americans would not remain in the city much longer
at the request of ambassador bishop major siad agreed to transport the soviets but only if he was paid enough the us embassy paid major siad who returned with the soviet ambassador and <num> of his staff
the brother of president barre who was also a major general and chief of police showed up at the embassy in the afternoon with <num> members of his family requesting to be evacuated but was turned away after a vocal conversation with the ambassador
the operation did not include soldiers to handle the evacuation control center <unk> which was set up in the <unk>
a <num> @-@ person force consisting primarily of soldiers to handle the <unk> was planned for insertion with the ch @-@ <unk> super stallions after they had returned to the guam
however this was cancelled over objections from the commander of the security detail
the deficit was partially handled by embassy staff who assisted a few soldiers from the security detail
the evacuees were grouped into <num> @-@ person sticks to be loaded onto the helicopters and were limited to one piece of luggage apiece
some attempted to bring more resulting in problems coordinating their evacuation
furthermore many evacuees had pets they wanted to bring which were not allowed
most pets were killed by their owners some were given poison
meanwhile the soldiers were allowed to consume anything they wanted from the embassy 's <unk> such as candy <unk> and souvenirs most had been stationed on ships for several months
they were also allowed use or take anything they needed from the embassy the medic filled several bags with medical supplies to return to the ship
as evening approached work began to prepare the <unk> for the main evacuation
the area was used as a parking lot and several vehicles were left without keys by staff that had already been evacuated
some cars had to be broken into to be moved
chemical lights were placed in the <unk> in a nato y pattern
the entire mission would be conducted with night vision goggles which required all lights in the embassy compound to be turned off
the timing of this phase was determined by range of the ch @-@ <num> sea knight which lack aerial refueling capability the ships were about <num> – <num> nautical miles <num> – <num> km <num> – <num> mi away during this phase
an ac @-@ <num> was sent from saudi arabia to provide gunfire support during the evacuation and two uh @-@ <num> iroquois helicopters were on standby to provide gunfire support but were not deployed
the first wave departed guam at <num> <num>
as the second wave landed major siad arrived at the embassy gate accompanied by two <unk> of soldiers and held a grenade in one hand and a radio in the other
his request to speak with the ambassador was granted
major siad demanded that the evacuation cease immediately because the somali government had not granted the us permission to carry out such a military operation
he claimed that he would radio soldiers to shoot down the helicopters if the operation continued
the second and third waves were able to depart without incident as the ambassador negotiated with the major who finally agreed to settle the matter for several thousand dollars in cash and keys to the ambassador 's armored car
ambassador bishop remained engaged in conversation with the major until he reached the helicopter landing zone to depart with the final wave to prevent the major from <unk> on the deal
the final wave departed the embassy at <num> <num> and landed on guam at <num> <num> twenty minutes later ambassador bishop declared the evacuation complete
the doors of the chancery — the main building of the embassy — were reportedly blown open by <unk> within two hours of the embassy 's evacuation
somali employees of the embassy — known as foreign service nationals <unk> — could not be evacuated
ambassador bishop tried unsuccessfully to have these employees airlifted to safer parts of somalia
many of the <unk> had sought refuge in the embassy with their families and about <num> were hired as guards and protected the embassy throughout the ordeal
local banks had been closed for some time and the embassy was unable to pay the <unk>
the ambassador left the <unk> with keys to the <unk> and warehouse on the embassy compound and they were permitted to take anything they needed
the heads of mission were the ambassadors of the united states kenya nigeria soviet union sudan turkey united arab emirates and united kingdom and the <unk> of the embassies of germany kuwait oman and qatar
rather than disembark in nearby <unk> as originally thought by the evacuees the ships were ordered back to oman — a five @-@ day journey
the sailors and marines made way for the evacuees to share living quarters
when the <unk> of guam asked crew to sign up as guides for the evacuees while aboard the vessel two hundred signed up within an hour and some of the sailors even dressed up as <unk> to ease the ordeal for children
at the request of the ambassadors a formal session with the ships senior officers was held to express their thanks
on <num> january the evacuees were <unk> at muscat oman
that afternoon the american evacuees were flown to frankfurt germany from where they continued home
it was hailed as the precursor to the new australian baseball league that will start in the place of the <unk> shield in late <year> to early <year>
the victoria aces defeated south australia two games to nil in the championship series to win the tournament this was the <num> time the <unk> shield had been awarded to a victorian team
the competition was sponsored by domino 's pizza
at the conclusion of the regular season the victoria aces finished in first place with a <num> – <num> record earning home @-@ field advantage for the three @-@ game championship series
south australia hosted the three @-@ game semi @-@ final series against the new south wales patriots
both teams finished with a <num> – <num> record
the perth heat <num> – <num> and queensland rams <num> – <num> both failed to qualify for the finals
the <year> tournament was considered preparation for the inaugural <unk> season starting in <year> – <num>
it varied from the <year> <unk> shield by expanding the season to include ten rounds
since an uneven number five teams were involved four teams paired off for each round and played a three @-@ game series while the remaining team took a bye
during the season each team had two bye rounds and played two rounds against each other team one at home and one away
in total the schedule allowed for <num> regular @-@ season games per team before a postseason similar to the <year> edition the first @-@ place team directly qualified for the championship series and played against the winner of a playoff series between the second- and third @-@ place teams
during the regular season games were played on a friday night and a doubleheader on saturday in each doubleheader one of the two games was shortened to seven innings
the exception to this was when perth played their home games they played on a thursday night instead of a doubleheader on saturday
each postseason series was scheduled for a friday saturday and sunday
exceptions were made in two cases that allowed teams active rosters to expand to <num> players both times for the same reason
two games during the season had to be postponed because of poor weather
both games involved teams meeting for the first time during the season make @-@ up games were scheduled at the start of the return series between the teams and this resulted in two four @-@ game series
in both cases the teams had a <num> @-@ man roster for the make @-@ up game and an expanded <num> @-@ man roster for the originally scheduled series
in previous years many of the teams had played their home games at multiple venues
this season each team held their home games at only one venue
there was one scheduled exception to this at the start of the season the new south wales patriots final home series against the perth heat was held at gilchrist oval whereas all of their other home games were held at <unk> baseball stadium
as a result of poor attendance at <unk> baseball park game one of the fifth @-@ round series between new south wales and the victoria aces was moved to la <unk> university melbourne
although the <unk> games had attracted crowds of no more than <num> the moved game had an attendance of <num> @,@ <num>
though no further regular season games were moved the finals series hosted by the aces was held at la <unk> university as well
‡ — a game postponed from round <num> held in round <num> was played with south australia as the away team and victoria aces as the home team despite being played at norwood oval adelaide south australia
the queensland rams were the first team to be eliminated from contention for the finals after being swept four games to nil by the victoria aces in round <num>
the following round saw south australia clinch a position in the finals despite finishing the round in second position
it was not until the final round that the last two spots in the finals were decided the aces clinched top spot by sweeping the perth heat which combined with the new south wales patriots sweep of the rams eliminated perth from contention and secured the last finals spot for the patriots
the top three teams at the conclusion of the ten rounds of regular @-@ season games qualified
the second- and third @-@ place teams faced in each other in a best @-@ of @-@ three series hosted by the second @-@ place team
the winner of that series then faced the first @-@ place team for a best @-@ of @-@ three series
south australia hosted the new south wales patriots at norwood oval adelaide while the victoria aces hosted the championship series at la <unk> university melbourne
in the finals the home team and away team alternated during each of the series
as a result south australia was officially the away team for game two of its series against new south wales as was victoria in the championship series
after defeating the patriots two games to one in the semi @-@ final series south australia progressed to the championship series against the aces
there they were defeated two games to nil
after game two of the championship series victoria 's matthew <unk> was named both <unk> shield final series mvp and pitcher of the year
matthew <unk> won both the pitcher of the year award and the finals series mvp award
at the baseball australia diamond awards held on <num> march at the hotel grand chancellor adelaide wayne <unk> was announced as the <num> winner of the helms award the <unk> shield 's most valuable player award

<unk> produced the album with dan warner who has worked with <unk> celine dion and christina aguilera
when promoting the album <unk> said songs are like women they get things up and are so concerned about this that they forget that the less clothes more beauty
the songs are often overwhelmed by ourselves because we <unk> them with arrangements looking to <unk> their qualities and we end up hiding them
<unk> <unk> became the first album since <unk> which <unk> recorded without torres
weeks before the release of <unk> <unk> issued a letter raising the issue of his past relationships with recording companies
he revealed the circumstances of his first contract a producer friend of mine told them the record label that if they did not sign me in they won 't sign two artists he had at that time
<unk> further explained that he received the minimum royalty percentage from his most successful albums
<unk> is <unk> 's first independent release through his own label <unk> a company he created to <unk> his career
the company is presided by <unk> and several friends including photographer @-@ director ricardo calderón universal music méxico executive <unk> <unk> and bmg 's miriam <unk> and is based in miami and mexico city
<unk> commented that his independence represented compromise more than freedom stating that inside the word independent even when it sounds like extreme freedom there 's a big amount of compromise and the responsibility of being able to <unk> in the best way possible such independence
billboard notes that although other groups have released independent albums following contracts with major labels <unk> is the most important latin pop artist to do so
although the album is marketed within the new label distribution was handled by warner music
the latter was a composer and producer also receiving background @-@ vocal credit
the musicians first worked together in <year> when <unk> released his tenth studio album <unk>
he stated that he first tested torres by sending him the <unk> and darkest tracks on the album <unk> a <unk> solo and <unk>

<unk> was mixed at the blue grotto in nashville tennessee and mastered by tom coyne and <unk> merrill at sterling sound in new york city
with torres return to producing <unk> regained the classic trademark sound which torres helped develop since <year>
el amor was motivated by <unk> 's desire to examine those big dark events within love that nobody talks about he continued the dark sides of love are extremely fundamental to understand its great value
<unk> added so many good things <unk> love has been shown that somebody had to turn it around and tell the bad ones
in a february <year> interview <unk> stated that el amor was the most <unk> song he had released to date explaining that their choice of the song was a contradiction because it was not the song which could better represent the entire album

as with his single señora de las <unk> <unk> on <year> 's <unk> at first he never thought to include the song on an album
caudillo evokes the image of some friends <unk> had at college he asserted that he appears constantly there because sometimes we transform ourselves into a contradiction of all those things we fought in those moments
it 's the history of a student leader that becomes a president

though every month with the exception of february and march featured tropical activity most storms developed from may through october
during the season tropical cyclones affected the philippines japan china the korean peninsula indochina and various islands in the western pacific
the season ran year @-@ round with the first storm <unk> developing west of the marshall islands on january <num>
in april typhoon <unk> became one of the longest @-@ lasting pacific typhoons in history and attained climatological records for its unusually early impacts
typhoon imbudo in july caused several deaths and extensive damage across the philippines and china
in september typhoon <unk> became one of the costliest typhoons in recorded history after striking south korea <unk> was also the most intense tropical cyclone of the season with a minimum barometric pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg
in late november typhoon <unk> devastated areas of yap state in the <unk> states of micronesia
the season closed with the dissipation of a tropical depression east of the philippines on december <num>
the scope of this article is limited to the pacific ocean north of the equator and west of the international date line
storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes see <year> pacific hurricane season
tropical storms formed in the entire west pacific basin are assigned a name by the tokyo typhoon center
tropical depressions in this basin monitored by the joint typhoon warning center jtwc have the w suffix added to their number
tropical depressions that enter or form in the philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration or pagasa
this can often result in the same storm having two names
the forecast indicated the potential for <num>
<num> tropical storms compared to the <num> – and <num> @-@ year average of <num>
<num> and <num>
<num> storms respectively
the following month the group raised their forecast for tropical storms to <num>
<num> indicating a slightly above average season
over next two months however fluctuations in sea surface temperatures particularly those in the central pacific caused the group to revise their predictions downward and indicated the probability for a slightly below average typhoon season in their june forecast
a rise in sea surface temperatures in the following months prompted the forecasting group to once again raise their forecasts to indicate a near @-@ average season in their final august forecast update which predicted <num> tropical storms
the group was very accurate in their forecasts with their april and august forecasts being the most accurate
similarly <unk> working with the city university of hong kong issued a seasonal projection on april <num> <year> indicating the likelihood of a normal or below normal season with <num> total tropical cyclones <num> tropical storms and <num> typhoons
as with the <unk> the group primarily based their forecast numbers on the prevailing status of the el niño @-@ southern oscillation
the city university of hong kong revised their forecasts on june <num> <year> indicating a slight increase of total tropical cyclones to <num>
the group was also accurate in their forecasts for the entirety of the northwest pacific though their specialized forecasts for the south china sea were substantially off
during the year the japan meteorological agency jma issued advisories on tropical cyclones west of the international date line to the malay peninsula and north of the equator this was due to the agency 's status as the official regional specialized meteorological center as designated by the world meteorological organization in <year>
the jma issued forecasts and analyses four times a day beginning at <num> utc and continuing every six hours
the jma issued forecasts based on a climatological tropical cyclone forecast model
the agency estimated <num> minute sustained winds and barometric pressure based on the dvorak technique and numerical weather prediction
the jtwc also issued warnings on storms within the basin operating from pearl harbor in hawaii to represent the interests of the united states armed forces in the indian and pacific oceans
areas of convection persisted year @-@ round in the lower latitudes particularly around the philippines
atmospheric divergence was also prevalent in the same regions resulting in enhanced tropical cyclogenesis east of the philippines in <year> the mean region of development of tropical systems during the year was more southwest than the <year> – <year> <num> @-@ year average
in <year> the jma monitored <num> tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity of those <num> reached typhoon intensity
though the number of tropical storms was below average the ratio between tropical storms and typhoons was <num> greater than normal
the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa monitored three additional cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity that were not monitored by the jma
the season began with the formation of tropical storm <unk> on january <num>
after its dissipation five days later no tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity developed over the next two months
this period of inactivity ended with the formation of typhoon <unk> in mid @-@ april <unk> was one of the longest lived pacific storms on record and was the first typhoon with <num> @-@ minute sustained winds of at least <num> km h <num> mph in april since typhoon isa in <year>
tropical activity was enhanced from may to june and during this period the jma monitored four tropical storms while the pagasa monitored a fifth storm off the eastern philippines
three of the four tropical storms monitored by the jma approached or hit japan including typhoon <unk> which brought heavy rainfall and wind across the ryukyu islands and the korean peninsula
tropical activity once again declined towards the second half of june and first half of july
the second half of july however featured the development of typhoons imbudo and koni which both tracked westward across the philippines before striking areas near <unk> and other regions of southeastern china
imbudo caused the deaths of <num> people and us <num> million in damage
august was a highly active month for tropical cyclogenesis with a total of six tropical storms monitored by the jma jtwc and pagasa
this included typhoons <unk> and <unk> which also struck southeastern china
typhoon <unk> earlier in the month made landfall in japan resulting in <num> deaths
activity was somewhat below average in september with only one tropical cyclone making landfall <unk>
however <unk> was the strongest tropical cyclone of the season and was the costliest with roughly us <num>
<num> billion in damage mostly in south korea
tropical cyclogenesis and activity continued to decline after august with october featuring only three tropical storms
however two <unk> and parma reached typhoon intensity both stayed away from land
november featured less storms but was climatologically average with two typhoons developing
the second typhoon <unk> devastated portions of yap state resulting in approximately <num>
<num> million in damage
in december the jtwc and pagasa monitored a sole tropical system east of the philippines though the jma did not monitor or classify any tropical cyclones during the month
this difference generally results in jtwc maximum winds appearing higher than the maximum winds described by the jma for the same cyclone
as the system tracked westward it gradually moved into a more favorable environment for tropical cyclogenesis
on january <num> surface observations indicated that the low @-@ pressure area had developed a closed low @-@ level circulation center indicative of a tropical cyclone satellite imagery remained inconclusive
nonetheless the jma classified the pressure area as a tropical depression west of the marshall islands at <num> utc on january <num>
the jtwc would follow suit by classifying the storm as such at <year> utc later that day
at the time the depression was tracking west @-@ northwest under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the north
over the next day the system waned in convective activity before resuming its previous track and accelerating
at <num> utc on january <num> the jtwc upgraded the system to tropical storm intensity though the storm remained nameless as the jma continued to classify it as a tropical depression
throughout january <num> the tropical storm would again <unk> in strength resulting in a brief downgrade by the jtwc to tropical depression intensity
however an increase in deep convection resulted in its reclassification as a tropical storm at <year> utc that day followed by the jma upgrading the system to tropical storm intensity at <num> utc on january <num>
as such the storm received the name <unk>
at roughly the same time the tropical cyclone began to stall east of the mariana islands and curve sharply northeastward
whilst the jtwc indicated that <unk> peaked in strength late on january <num> with <num> @-@ minute sustained winds of <num> km h <num> mph the jma considered the system to have maintained the same intensity throughout its stint as a tropical storm
steered by the same nearby subtropical ridge <unk> would continue to track towards the northeast into a less favorable tropical cyclone environment
the jma downgraded <unk> to tropical depression at <num> utc on january <num> before the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as its low @-@ level circulation center decoupled from the primary mass of convection due to strong wind shear
at <num> utc both the jtwc and jma discontinued the monitoring of <unk>
shortly after development <unk> quickly intensified in its early stages and was upgraded to a tropical storm just two days after cyclogenesis
strengthening slowed afterwards though the storm attained typhoon intensity on april <num>
intensification continued and late on april <num> <unk> reached its peak intensity with winds of <num> km h <num> mph and a minimum barometric pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg
following peak intensity <unk> would begin to track northwest and <unk> in strength cresting an additional two times in intensity
on april <num> the typhoon was downgraded to tropical storm intensity and began to track <unk> for several days east of taiwan
however on april <num> <unk> would resume a northward track and begin to weaken and on april <num> was downgraded to tropical depression strength as it made landfall on <unk>
following landfall <unk> transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on april <num> which persisted until crossing the international dateline towards the end of april <year>
shortly after developing <unk> caused two fatalities in <unk> in addition to minor agricultural and infrastructural damage similar effects were felt in guam
several days later the typhoon prompted cyclone warnings and other precautionary measures in the philippines after forecasts indicated the potential for strong winds and rain
however ultimately any effects in the archipelago associated with <unk> remained minimal
the typhoon also prompted warning products in taiwan making it the first april typhoon since <year> to cause such a feat
unlike in the philippines however <unk> would bring significant rainfall to taiwan
effects from the typhoon were most significant in japan particularly in the ryukyu islands
strong winds rain and waves caused us <num> @,@ <num> ¥ <num>
<num> million in agricultural damage on <unk> island
one person was killed due to injuries resulting from the waves
in <unk> heavy rainfall peaking at <num> mm <num>
<num> in in <unk> prefecture was reported
overall despite its distance away from land and weak intensity at the time of its sole landfall <unk> resulted in three fatalities
within highly conductive conditions the disturbance quickly organized and became classified as a tropical depression at <num> utc the following day
in its initial stages the depression tracked slowly <unk>
however a <unk> trough forced a weakness in a nearby ridge allowing for the storm to take a more streamlined northward path
at <num> utc on may <num> the jma upgraded the depression to tropical storm chan @-@ <unk>
following the system 's naming chan @-@ <unk> temporarily meandered towards the northwest before resuming its northeasterly track
the next day the storm began to develop an eye this was reflected with an upgrade by the jma to typhoon status at <num> utc on may <num>
gradual intensification followed and at <year> utc that day chan @-@ <unk> reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of <num> km h <num> mph and a minimum pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg
following peak intensity chan @-@ <unk> began to intake dry air beginning on may <num>
at roughly the same time the typhoon began to weaken and accelerate towards the northeast
conditions continued to worsen as the storm moved further north and as the cyclone passed east of <unk> it was downgraded to tropical storm classification
by this time chan @-@ <unk> had lost much of its convection due to wind shear
early on may <num> chan @-@ <unk> had fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and these remnants continued to track towards the northeast
these extratropical remnants dissipated south of the aleutian islands the following day
early in the typhoon 's existence chan @-@ <unk> posed a potential threat to guam but remained well east of the island
however after passing to the northeast winds from the typhoon fanned volcanic ash from the recently erupting <unk> volcano towards the island prompting precautionary measures in guam
<unk> were reported on the island forcing the cancellation of several flights
as a tropical storm chan @-@ <unk> caused some damage to homes and crops on <unk> mostly due to heavy rains brought forth by the storm
offshore a <num> @,@ <num> ton fishing vessel the <unk> <unk> sank during the storm
the ship was valued at <num> million
the disturbance quickly intensified to reach tropical storm intensity a few hours after cyclogenesis
however intensification leveled off as <unk> executed a small clockwise loop before a subsequent landfall on luzon on may <num>
due to land interaction the storm temporarily weakened and decoupled before reforming in the philippine sea
afterwards <unk> began <unk> and reached its peak intensity on may <num> with maximum sustained winds of <num> km h <num> mph and a barometric pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg
following its peak the tropical storm began to deteriorate and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on may <num> these extratropical remnants continued to track northward through japan before dissipating in the sea of <unk> on june <num>
the erratic and slow movement of <unk> off the western philippines was the catalyst for extreme rainfall and flooding killing <num> persons in the archipelago
precipitation peaked at <num> mm <num>
<num> in near <unk>
rising floodwaters resulted in the temporary shutdown of government offices and numerous mudslides
in addition strong winds caused widespread power outages
overall damage from <unk> in the philippines amounted to <unk> <num>
<num> million us <num>
<num> million
the floods also displaced <num> @,@ <num> people in <num> @,@ <num> families and destroyed <num> homes
<unk> and its extratropical remnants later brought torrential rainfall and widespread flooding to japan particularly in southwestern regions
rainfall there peaked at <num> mm <num>
<num> in
flood damage was worst in <unk> and <unk> prefectures where several buildings were destroyed by floodwater
other locations in japan experienced considerable agricultural damage as well as numerous landslides
overall <unk> caused roughly <num>
<num> million in damage much of which occurred in japan though the entirety of deaths associated with the cyclone took place in the philippines
the jtwc began to monitor the storm cluster on may <num>
the following day the jma reclassified the system as a tropical depression initially the system remained highly disorganized due to the lack of deep convection
persistent moderate wind shear and dry air prevented the cyclone from strengthening significantly in the storm 's early stages
these conditions <unk> as the depression tracked northeast and at <num> utc on june <num> the jma upgraded the system to tropical storm <unk>
throughout the course of the day <unk> continued to strengthen as it accelerated northeast and peaked in strength with a barometric pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg and maximum sustained winds of <num> km h <num> mph making it a severe tropical storm
however upon moving through the <unk> channel conditions began to deteriorate due to increased wind shear weakening the system and resulting in its downgrade to tropical depression status by the jma at <num> utc on june <num>
<unk> continued to become increasingly disorganized as it moved further north and late that day the depression transitioned to an extratropical cyclone
the resulting remnants continued to track well east of japan before dissipating on june <num>
due to its track away from landmasses damage remained minimal however as <unk> passed to the south and east of japan the storm brought light rainfall to the country peaking at <num> mm <num>
<num> in in <unk> okinawa
on june <num> the shear decreased enough to allow the convection to organize and the next day the jma classified it as a tropical depression northeast of palau
on june <num> the jma upgraded it to tropical storm <unk> to the east of the philippines and pagasa gave it the local name <unk>
<unk> moved to the northwest and later to the north parallel to the eastern philippines and on june <num> the jma upgraded it to typhoon status
the storm rapidly intensified to the east of taiwan as it developed a well @-@ defined eye and while doing so passed over the japanese island of <unk> @-@ jima at around <year> utc on june <num>
at <num> utc on june <num> the jtwc estimated peak <num> minute winds of <num> km h <num> mph while the jma estimated peak <num> minute winds of <num> km h <num> mph
increased shear weakened the typhoon to tropical storm strengthen on june <num> and later that day the jma declared the storm as extratropical near the <unk> islands
the extratropical remnants of <unk> continued to the northeast crossing northern japan on june <num> and dissipating on june <num>
while offshore the philippines <unk> dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding and left thousands homeless
the storm caused <unk> <num> million php <num>
<num> million usd in damage and <num> deaths
on the japanese island of <unk> @-@ jima where wind gusts reached <num> km h <num> mph
it also affected taiwan where floods covered highways and caused mudslides
in japan the storm caused widespread power outages although damage was minimal and there were <num> injuries
in south korea there was <num>
<num> million in damage and two deaths
a subtropical ridge near okinawa steered the nascent depression to the west @-@ northwest for much of its duration
with warm waters and favorable upper @-@ level conditions the depression quickly organized first to tropical storm imbudo on july <num> and to typhoon status two days later when pagasa begin issuing advisories on typhoon harurot
around that time imbudo was rapidly intensifying developing a well @-@ defined eye
at <num> utc on july <num> the jma estimated peak <num> minute sustained winds of <num> km h <num> mph and the same time the jtwc estimated <num> minute sustained winds of <num> km h <num> mph making it a super typhoon
imbudo maintained peak winds for about <num> hours before undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle
at <num> utc on july <num> imbudo struck northern luzon with <num> minute winds estimated at <num> km h <num> mph by the jtwc
it weakened over land but re @-@ intensified in the south china sea striking southern china near yangjiang guangdong on july <num>
imbudo rapidly weakened dissipating on july <num>
in the philippines officials evacuated over <num> @,@ <num> people

<num> in at hepu county in guangxi province
there <num> people died from the storm
overall damage in china was about ¥ <num>
<num> billion cny <num> million usd
tracking westward intensification was slow and the system remained a tropical depression as it moved across the central philippines on july <num>
upon moving into the south china sea conditions allowed for quicker strengthening and the cyclone reached tropical storm status on july <num> before reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of <num> km h <num> mph making it a severe tropical storm
however atmospheric conditions began to deteriorate as koni made landfall on hainan on july <num> weakening the system
the tropical storm continued to weaken as it moved over the gulf of tonkin prior to a final landfall near hanoi vietnam the following day
tracking inland the combination of land interaction and wind shear caused koni to dissipate over laos on july <num>
shortly after development koni tracked through the philippines killing two people
after moving into the south china sea turbulence produced by the storm resulted in an aviation incident involving a commercial airliner off the western philippines
three of the plane 's occupants received minor injuries
in hainan koni caused heavy rainfall peaking at <num> mm <num>
<num> in at a station on <unk> mountain
the rains resulted in the collapse of <num> @,@ <num> homes and an estimated cn ¥ <num>
<num> million us <num>
<num> million in direct economic losses
effects were worst in vietnam where three people were killed
widespread power outages occurred and strong winds resulted in agricultural and infrastructural damage particularly in vietnam 's northern provinces
tracking northwest favorable conditions allowed for the intensification of the system to tropical storm strength on august <num>
<unk> reached peak intensity later that day with winds of <num> km h <num> mph and a minimum barometric pressure of <num> mbar hpa <num>
<num> inhg
this intensity was held for several hours until less conducive atmospheric conditions slightly weakened the system this was followed by <unk> making landfall on southern taiwan on august <num>
subsequently the storm weakened and moved into the taiwan strait before making its final landfall near quanzhou china the next day
the storm quickly weakened over the chinese mainland and dissipated entirely several hours after landfall
in taiwan where <unk> first made landfall heavy rainfall resulted in flooding
commercial flights schools and rail service in some areas was cancelled in advance of the storm
precipitation there peaked at <num> mm <num>
<num> in over a period of nearly two days in taitung county
crop damage also resulted from the rainfall and was estimated at over <unk> <num> million us <num> million
in china record rainfall was reported
the worst impacted city was quanzhou where losses due to <unk> reached cn ¥ <num> million us <num> million and one death was reported
power outages were also widespread across southeastern china
due to <unk> drought conditions <num> cloud <unk> operations took place in order to artificially generate added rainfall such operations resulted in moderate precipitation over the targeted area
overall <unk> caused roughly <num> million in damage and three deaths
<unk> formed an eye and became a large storm by the time it approached okinawa on august <num>
the typhoon attained peak winds of <num> km h <num> mph before weakening slightly while turning to the northeast
<unk> made landfall on the japanese island of <unk> on august <num> and later moved across portions of <unk> and <unk>
after weakening to tropical storm status the cyclone became extratropical on august <num> and dissipated three days later
while passing northeast of the philippines the typhoon caused light damage in the archipelago
the eye crossed over okinawa where <unk> left <num> @,@ <num> people without power and caused <num> injuries
near where <unk> first struck japan <unk> reported a peak wind gust of <num> km h <num> mph at the time the third strongest on record there
the typhoon also dropped torrential rainfall peaking at <num> mm <num>
<num> in
the combination of winds and rainfall caused landslides particularly on <unk>
nationwide <unk> killed <num> people destroyed <num> houses and caused ¥ <num>
<num> billion <unk> <num>
<num> million usd in damage
despite rather favorable conditions the initial tropical depression did not intensify significantly and degenerated into a remnant low on august <num>
however these remnants were able to reorganize and the system was reclassified as a tropical cyclone a day later
intensification was rather rapid upon the storm 's reformation – the depression reached tropical storm status on august <num> and then typhoon intensity two days later
shortly after <unk> made landfall on luzon at peak intensity with winds of <num> km h <num> mph
the typhoon emerged into the south china sea as a much weaker tropical storm though it was able to <unk> over warm waters
once again at typhoon intensity <unk> clipped hainan before moving over the <unk> peninsula on its way to a final landfall near <unk> <unk> vietnam on august <num>
quick weakening due to land interaction occurred as <unk> moved across northern vietnam where the storm met its demise the following day
<unk> first struck the philippines resulting in heavy rainfall and displacing approximately <num> @,@ <num> families
the flooding caused severe damage and killed one person
<unk> 's effects were much more severe in china
in hong kong eleven people were injured and isolated flooding occurred as a result of the typhoon 's outer rainbands
however guangdong province hainan province and guangxi were the chinese regions most extensively impacted
the typhoon brought record wind gusts into guangxi
in those three regions combined <num> @,@ <num> homes were estimated to have collapsed and a large swath of farmland was damaged
two people were killed in china and economic losses approximated to ¥ <num>
<num> billion us <num> million
due to its positioning and track of all areas in vietnam only the country 's more northern regions were impacted by <unk>
flash flooding occurred in earnest in those regions and <num> @,@ <num> homes were flattened
one person was killed and five others were injured in vietnam
overall the typhoon was responsible for the deaths of four persons
on august <num> an area of convection persisted on the southern side of a circulation developing into a tropical depression east of luzon
it moved quickly northward and later to the northwest in an area generally unfavorable for strengthening such as the presence of wind shear and land interaction
on august <num> the jma upgraded the depression to tropical storm <unk> to the east of taiwan
later that day the circulation passed just <num> km <num> mi north of taipei although the convection was exposed that time
on august <num> the jma assessed <unk> as dissipating in the taiwan strait although the jtwc continued advisories until the storm moved ashore in southeastern china

on august <num> the jma upgraded it to tropical storm <unk> and that day pagasa began issuing advisories on tropical storm <unk>
the storm quickly intensified into a typhoon after developing an eye in the center
on september <num> the jma estimated <unk> attained peak <num> minute winds of <num> km h <num> mph and the jtwc assessed peak <num> – minute winds of <num> km h <num> mph
while near peak intensity the center of <unk> passed about <num> km <num> mi south of the southern tip of taiwan
the typhoon weakened steadily and was a severe tropical storm by the time it made landfall on september <num> just east of hong kong
the jtwc estimated landfall winds of <num> km h <num> mph making it the strongest typhoon to strike the pearl river delta since typhoon hope in <year>

across guangdong the typhoon damaged crops and destroyed <num> @,@ <num> homes were destroyed
overall damage in china was estimated at ¥ <num>
<num> billion cny <num> million usd and across guangdong the typhoon killed <num> people
it slowly intensified into a tropical storm while moving northwestward and <unk> became a typhoon on september <num>
that day it quickly intensified due to favorable conditions developing a well @-@ defined eye and reaching peak maximum sustained winds of <num> km h <num> mph
while near peak intensity <unk> was <unk> and began turning to the north @-@ northeast
the eyewall soon after passed over the japanese island of <unk> @-@ jima on september <num> producing the fourth lowest pressure on record in japan after a pressure of <num> mbar <num>

with warm waters <unk> was able to maintain much of its intensity before it made landfall just west of busan south korea on september <num>
on <unk> island <unk> produced a peak wind gust of <num> km h <num> mph and a minimum pressure of <num> mbar <num> inhg both setting records for the country and making it the most powerful typhoon to strike south korea since record @-@ keeping began in the country in <year>
the typhoon became extratropical in the sea of japan the next day although the remnants persisted for several more days bringing strong winds to northern japan
the typhoon first affected the ryukyu islands of japan

on september <num> the jma classified it as a tropical depression and the jtwc initiated advisories the next day
the system moved to the northwest due to the subtropical ridge to the northeast and later to the north
on september <num> the jma upgraded the depression to tropical storm <unk> @-@ wan the same day that pagasa classified it as tropical storm <unk>
an eastward @-@ moving trough turned the storm to the northeast bringing the track over okinawa and <unk> <unk> on september <num>
<unk> @-@ wan continued gradually intensifying becoming a typhoon on september <num> to the southeast of japan
that day the jma estimated peak winds of <num> km h <num> mph and the jtwc estimated peak <num> minute winds of <num> km h <num> mph on september <num> after <unk> @-@ wan developed a well @-@ defined eye
the typhoon weakened due to increasing wind shear deteriorating to severe tropical storm status on september <num> before jma declared it extratropical on september <num>

there were initially several <unk> with a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northeast increasing outflow
after slowing and turning to the northeast the depression intensified into tropical storm <unk> on september <num>
after the storm developed a large eye feature the jtwc upgraded it to typhoon status on september <num> although the jma did not follow suit until the following day while near <unk> @-@ jima
also that day <unk> passed <num> km <num> mi west of iwo jima and the jma estimated peak <num> minute winds of <num> km h <num> mph
the jtwc estimated peak <num> minute winds of <num> km h <num> mph before an approaching trough caused the typhoon to accelerate northeastward
the convection diminished near the center causing <unk> to become extratropical on september <num>
the remnants continued generally northeastward through the aleutian islands eventually passing south of mainland alaska on october <num>
on <unk> @-@ jima typhoon <unk> produced sustained winds of <num> km h <num> mph with gusts to <num> km h <num> mph which was the third strongest on record for the station
rainfall there reached <num> mm <num>
<num> in
wind gusts on iwo jima peaked at <num> km h <num> mph
the same monsoon trough later spawned typhoon parma to the east
for several days the system remained disorganized while drifting to the west @-@ northwest due to weak steering currents south of the subtropical ridge
on october <num> the jma upgraded the depression to tropical storm <unk> and by that time the storm had begun drifting to the northeast
with favorable outflow <unk> quickly intensified into a typhoon on october <num> after developing an eye and two days later the jma estimated peak winds of <num> km h <num> mph
the jtwc estimated peak <num> minute winds of <num> km h <num> mph around the time the well @-@ defined eye had expanded to <num> km <num> mi
subsequently the typhoon accelerated northeastward into the westerlies and began weakening due to increasing wind shear and dry air
on october <num> <unk> became extratropical to the east of japan and dissipated the next day
the passage of the typhoon caused surface <unk> a concentration in the ocean to increase <num> @-@ fold
the system moved northwestward and later turned to the northeast around the subtropical ridge
with low wind shear and favorable outflow the convection became better organized and the jma upgraded it to tropical storm parma on october <num>
after an eye began to form parma was upgraded to typhoon status the next day
an approaching trough caused parma to accelerate northeastward while also increasing outflow
on october <num> the jma estimated peak winds of <num> km h <num> mph while the jtwc estimated winds of <num> km h <num> mph an unusually high intensity for <num> ° n
subsequently parma rounded the subtropical ridge and began moving to the east @-@ southeast beginning a nearly week @-@ long loop
the cold front had passed to the north and failed to bring the typhoon northeastward
increasing wind shear weakened the convection and parma deteriorated into a severe tropical storm on october <num>
the next day it began moving westward while passing about <num> km <num> mi north of wake island
a large eye of <num> km <num> mi in diameter developed and on october <num> the jma re @-@ upgraded parma to typhoon status
the next day the typhoon turned to the northeast due to another approaching trough
with decreasing wind shear and warmer waters parma re @-@ intensified significantly on october <num> reaching a secondary peak of <num> km h <num> mph according to jma and <num> km h <num> mph according to jtwc
the storm moved very closely along the track it took several days prior
increasing wind shear on october <num> caused rapid weakening resulting in the eye dissipating
by the next day the center was exposed and parma became extratropical later exiting the basin on november <num>
the remnants weakened later turning to the southeast and dissipating on november <num> southwest of california
moving west @-@ northwestward toward the philippines due to a ridge to the east the depression intensified into tropical storm <unk> on october <num>
with minimal wind shear the storm strengthened further and developed a large eye
the jtwc upgraded <unk> to typhoon status on october <num> estimating peak <num> minute winds of <num> km h <num> mph although the jma estimated the storm only attained peak <num> minute winds of <num> km h <num> mph
early on november <num> <unk> made landfall on northeastern luzon in the philippines south of <unk>
the storm weakened over land and emerged into the south china sea
by that time it was moving northward along the periphery of the ridge to the east
on november <num> <unk> turned to the northeast passing just east of taiwan
the next day it weakened to tropical depression status and after meandering offshore eastern taiwan <unk> continued northeastward
it became extratropical on november <num> and dissipated the next day near southern japan
in the philippines <unk> dropped about <num> mm <num> in of rainfall which flooded the cagayan river and killed four people
in taiwan rainfall reached <num> mm <num>
<num> in in <unk> county
on the japanese island of <unk> rainfall totaled <num> mm <num>
<num> in which broke the hourly and daily record for the station in november
the system intensified gradually as it tracked quickly westward toward the philippines
an anticyclone aloft allowed for strengthening and the jma upgraded the depression to tropical storm <unk> on november <num>
simultaneously the cyclone entered the area of responsibility of the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration which named it tropical storm <unk>
at around <year> utc on november <num> <unk> made landfall on northern <unk> island in the philippines before traversing the remainder of the archipelago from east to west
the cyclone emerged into the south china sea weakened but quickly re @-@ intensified while continuing to the west @-@ northwest
the jtwc estimated peak winds of <num> km h <num> mph on november <num> and later that day the jma upgraded the storm to typhoon status estimating peak <num> @-@ minute winds of <num> km h <num> mph
on november <num> <unk> passed near southwestern hainan and weakened with the convection diminishing from the circulation
by the next day the system weakened to tropical depression status and dissipated shortly after moving ashore over <unk> china
in the philippines <unk> produced strong winds heavy rainfall and rough seas
the storm caused widespread power outages and ferry disruptions
according to the pagasa in its post @-@ storm report a total of <num> people lost their lives during the storm
on hainan the storm helped end one of the worst summer droughts in almost <num> years although it also left heavy crop damage <unk> <num> @,@ <num> ha <num> @,@ <num> acres of fields and killing <num> head of livestock
with about <num> homes destroyed damage on hainan amounted to <num> million <year> usd
effects were minor in mainland china
early in its duration it moved generally to the west or west @-@ southwest
on november <num> the depression intensified into tropical storm <unk> and two days later it strengthened into a typhoon developing an eye
<unk> later began a prolonged movement to the northwest during which it passed near several islands in yap state
the typhoon reached peak intensity on november <num> with peak <num> – minute sustained winds of <num> km h <num> mph
it later weakened due to a variety of unfavorable conditions and after recurving to the northeast <unk> became extratropical south of japan on december <num>
typhoon <unk> first affected <unk> with gusty winds and later it damaged or destroyed about <num> homes in <unk> state
there high waves flooded roads and homes while high winds damaged crops
damage was heaviest in yap state mostly in the small <unk> atoll and <unk> island
on both islands the typhoon contaminated the water supply and wrecked the crops
rainfall reached <num> mm <num>
<num> in on <unk> and gusts reached <num> km h <num> mph
throughout the <unk> damage totaled about <num>
<num> million although there were no deaths
the damage prompted the <unk> government to declare two states as disaster areas as well as a disaster declaration from the united states federal government
while <unk> was becoming extratropical it became the first typhoon in december to threaten japan in <num> years
the storm dropped rainfall that resulted in mudslides and flight <unk>
the next day the jma and the jtwc both classified the system as a tropical depression
the convection was disorganized in association with multiple circulation centers although it gradually organized
moving westward initially the depression turned more to the north into an area of increasing wind shear
on may <num> the jtwc upgraded the system to tropical storm <unk> and on the same day pagasa classified it as tropical depression <unk>
soon after the convection decreased from the center and by may <num> all warning agencies had discontinued advisories
on july <num> pagasa classified a system as tropical depression falcon off the west coast of the philippines

pagasa names for storms are provided in parentheses
storms entering from the central pacific only include their information while in the western pacific and are noted with an asterisk
in their largest application <unk> are <unk> in the industrial production of <unk>
<unk> derivatives are also used as specialized reagents in organic chemistry for a variety of <unk> including alpha <unk> of <unk> epoxidation and <unk> of olefins and other heteroatom transfer reactions
<unk> also serve as precursors to amides and participate in <num> <num> cycloadditions with various <unk> to form substituted five @-@ membered <unk>
chiral <unk> derivatives effect asymmetric oxygen transfer to <unk> <unk> as well as other substrates
some <unk> also have the property of a high barrier to inversion of the nitrogen allowing for the possibility of <unk> at the nitrogen center
whereas oxygen and nitrogen typically act as <unk> due to their high <unk> <unk> allow for <unk> transfer of both <unk>
this unusual reactivity is due to the presence of the highly strained three membered ring and the relatively weak n @-@ o bond
<unk> tend to attack at the aziridine nitrogen when the nitrogen <unk> is small r1 h and at the oxygen atom when the nitrogen <unk> has greater steric bulk
the unusual electronics of the <unk> system may be exploited to perform a number of oxygen and nitrogen transfer reactions including but not limited to α @-@ <unk> of <unk> epoxidation of <unk> selective oxidation of sulfides and selenides <unk> of n @-@ <unk> and n @-@ <unk>
the <unk> process for the industrial production of <unk> through the oxidation of ammonia with hydrogen <unk> in the presence of ketones was developed in the early <num>
chiral <unk> proved useful in the syntheses of complex natural product such as taxol which is marketed as a chemotherapy agent
both the <unk> taxol total synthesis and the <unk> taxol total synthesis feature asymmetric α @-@ <unk> with <unk>
additionally oxidation of chiral <unk> and oxidation of <unk> with chiral <unk> may yield <unk> <unk>
some <unk> have the unique property of <unk> stable nitrogen atoms at room temperature due to an inversion barrier of <num> to <num> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> where stereochemistry is entirely due to <unk> stable nitrogen are reported
davis synthesized the first n @-@ <unk> which act exclusively as oxygen transfer reagents and are the most predominantly used class of <unk> today
while originally synthesized with <unk> and the phase transfer catalyst <unk> chloride an improved synthesis using <unk> as the <unk> is now most prevalent
many n @-@ <unk> are used today each with slightly different properties and reactivity
these reagents are summarized in the table below
notably <unk> <unk> certain c @-@ h bonds with high selectivity
<unk> <unk> may be synthesized by subjecting a <unk> imine to <unk> <unk> <unk> and a metal fluoride to act as an hf scavenger
α @-@ <unk> have been synthesized in many ways including reduction of α @-@ <unk> substitution of a <unk> for a leaving group and direct oxidation of an <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and n @-@ <unk> are the most common <unk> sources of oxygen implemented in this process
one advantage of using n @-@ <unk> is that higher chiral induction is almost invariably observed relative to <unk> and other <unk>
high yield <num> @-@ <num> and dr <num> <num> <num> <num> are reported for α @-@ <unk> with the evans chiral auxiliary with n @-@ <unk> as the <unk>
chiral induction has been demonstrated with many other chiral ketones and ketones with chiral auxiliaries including <unk> and ramp
extensive work has been reported on asymmetric <unk> of <unk> <unk> with <unk> derivatives achieving moderate to high enantiomeric excess
the commonly accepted proposed transition state that justifies this <unk> outcome involves an open transition state where the steric bulk of r1 determines the face of approach
the selectivity of some <unk> may be drastically improved in some cases with the addition of coordinating groups alpha to the <unk> ring as <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the table above
in these instances it is proposed that the reaction proceeds through a closed transition state where the metal <unk> is stabilized by <unk> from the sulfate and coordinating groups on the camphor skeleton
α @-@ <unk> with <unk> has been widely implemented in total synthesis
it is a key step in both the <unk> taxol total synthesis and the <unk> taxol total synthesis
additionally forsyth implemented the transformation in his synthesis of the c3 @-@ <unk> substituted <num> @,@ <num> @-@ <unk> <num>
<num> <unk> @-@ <num> @-@ <unk> system of <unk> acid
classically laboratory epoxidation is carried out with <unk> or other <unk>
<unk> have been found to be useful for the formation of highly acid sensitive epoxides
− <unk> was synthesized via <unk> epoxidation as a late stage transformation as seen below
another transformation of high synthetic utility is asymmetric epoxidation
a number of asymmetric <unk> exist the <unk> epoxidation the jacobsen @-@ <unk> epoxidation and the <unk> @-@ colonna epoxidation
these methods require specific functionality in order to achieve selectivity
the <unk> epoxidation is specific to <unk> <unk> the jacobsen epoxidation requires cis @-@ disubstituted aryl <unk> and the <unk> epoxidation requires α @-@ β unsaturated ketones
chiral <unk> act <unk> on many <unk> <unk>
it has even possible to effect <unk> epoxidation <unk> in the <unk> chiral unit
further investigation into these reactions may be required before levels of <unk> excess become practical for large scale synthesis
<unk> et al
have investigated asymmetric epoxidation with a chiral <unk> salt using <unk> as the stoichiometric <unk> seen below
this is a highly coveted transformation and similar reactivity and specificity is seldom rivaled especially considering the <unk> nature of the <unk>
<unk> <unk> show high selectivity toward tertiary hydrogens
<unk> of primary carbons and <unk> of a compound with two <unk> sites have never been observed
retention of stereochemistry is very high often <num> <num>
<unk> of stereochemistry may be further enhanced by the addition of a fluoride salt
<unk> may be derived from the <unk> of secondary or tertiary <unk> <unk> and <unk> may be formed from their corresponding <unk> and <unk> <unk> may be formed from <unk> and α @-@ <unk> may be formed by attack of corresponding <unk>
<unk> transfer has primarily been performed using <unk> and <unk> as <unk>
very few transfers of <unk> <unk> to carbon <unk> have been successfully performed although some do exist in the literature
<unk> <unk> undergo ring expansions to the corresponding <unk>
<unk> the migrating <unk> is determined by a <unk> effect where the group trans to the lone pair on the nitrogen will always be the predominant migration product
in light of this effect it is possible to take advantage of the chiral nitrogen due to high inversion barrier to direct the rearrangement
this phenomenon is demonstrated by observed <unk> in the rearrangements below
in the rearrangement on the left the thermodynamically unfavorable product is observed exclusively while in the reaction on the right the product derived from the less stable radical intermediate is favored
<unk> takes advantage of this rearrangement as the key step in his synthesis of <unk> a natural medicine classified by the nih as possibly effective in the treatment of erectile dysfunction and the sexual problems caused by selective serotonin <unk> inhibitors
it is also notable that <unk> will <unk> rearrange to <unk>
cis @-@ trans selectivity of the resulting <unk> is poor however yields are good to excellent
it is thought that some <unk> <unk> over time through a <unk> intermediate
this reactivity is due to the strained three membered ring and weak n @-@ o bond
<unk> modern <unk> is located in the <unk> valley on the river <unk> <num> kilometers <num> mi upstream from vienna austria
the river makes a crescent @-@ shaped curve between <unk> and nearby <unk> an der <unk> and the battle was fought in the flood plain between the river and the mountains
at <unk> a combined force of russian and austrian troops trapped a french division commanded by <unk> <unk> <unk>
the french division was part of the newly created viii corps the so @-@ called corps <unk> under command of édouard <unk>
in pursuing the austrian retreat from bavaria <unk> had over @-@ extended his three divisions along the north bank of the <unk>
mikhail <unk> <unk> commander of the coalition force enticed <unk> to send <unk> 's division into a trap and french troops were caught in a valley between two russian columns
they were rescued by the timely arrival of a second division under command of pierre dupont de l <unk>
the battle extended well into the night
both sides claimed victory
the french lost more than a third of their participants and <unk> 's division experienced over <num> percent losses
the austrians and russians also had heavy <unk> to <num> <unk> perhaps the most significant was the death in action of johann heinrich von <unk> one of austria 's most capable chiefs of staff
the battle was fought three weeks after the austrian capitulation at ulm and three weeks before the russo @-@ austrian defeat at the battle of <unk>
after <unk> austria withdrew from the war
the french demanded a high indemnity and francis ii abdicated as holy roman emperor releasing the german states from their allegiance to the holy roman empire
like the wars sparked by the french revolution <year> these further revolutionized the formation organization and training of european armies and led to an unprecedented <unk> mainly due to mass conscription
under the leadership of napoleon french power rose quickly as the grande <unk> conquered most of europe and collapsed rapidly after the disastrous invasion of russia in <year>
napoleon 's empire ultimately suffered complete military defeat in the <year> – <num> campaigns resulting in the restoration of the bourbon monarchy in france
although napoleon made a spectacular return in <year> known as the hundred days his defeat at the battle of waterloo the pursuit of his army and himself his abdication and banishment to the island of saint helena concluded the napoleonic wars
although several naval battles determined control of the seas the outcome of the war was decided on the continent predominantly in two major land operations in the <unk> valley the ulm campaign in the upper <unk> and the vienna campaign in the middle <unk> valley
political conflicts in vienna delayed austria 's entry into the third coalition until <year>
after hostilities of the war of the second coalition ended in <year> archduke <unk> emperor 's <unk> advantage of the subsequent years of peace to develop a military restructuring plan
he carefully put this plan into effect beginning in <year> – <num> but implementation was incomplete in <year> when karl mack lieutenant field marshal and quartermaster @-@ general of the army implemented his own restructuring
mack bypassed charles methodical approach
occurring in the field mack 's plan also undermined the overall command and <unk> structure
regardless mack sent an enthusiastic report to vienna on the military 's readiness
furthermore after misreading napoleon 's maneuvers in <unk> mack also reported to vienna on the weakness of french <unk>
his reports convinced the war party advising the emperor francis ii to enter the conflict against france despite charles own advice to the contrary
responding to the report and rampant anti @-@ french fever in vienna francis dismissed charles from his post as <unk> and appointed his <unk> brother @-@ in @-@ law archduke ferdinand as commander
the inexperienced ferdinand was a poor choice of replacement for the capable charles having neither maturity nor aptitude for the assignment
although ferdinand retained nominal command day @-@ to @-@ day decisions were placed in the hands of mack equally ill @-@ suited for such an important assignment
when mack was wounded early in the campaign he was unable to take full charge of the army
consequently command further devolved to lieutenant field marshal karl philipp prince of <unk> an able cavalry officer but inexperienced in the command of such a large army
near the bavarian town of <unk> <num> kilometers <num> mi northwest of <unk> on <num> october the 1st regiment of dragoons part of <unk> 's reserve cavalry corps and grenadiers of <unk> v corps surprised an austrian force half its size
the austrians were arrayed in a line and unable to form their defensive squares quickly enough to protect themselves from the <num> @,@ <num> dragoons and <num> @,@ <num> grenadiers
nearly <num> @,@ <num> austrians were captured and over <num> were killed or wounded
a day later at another small town <unk> south of the <unk> <unk> french <num> regiment of the line stormed a bridge over the <unk> and <unk> chased two large austrian columns toward ulm
the campaign was not entirely bad news for vienna
at <unk> johann von <unk> arranged his <num> @,@ <num> infantry and cavalry in a prime defensive position and on <num> october the overly confident general of division pierre dupont de l <unk> attacked <unk> 's force with fewer than <num> @,@ <num> men
the french lost <num> @,@ <num> men killed and wounded
aside from taking the imperial eagles and <unk> of the <num> and <num> dragoons <unk> 's force also captured <num> men <num> guns and <num> ammunition wagons
<unk> 's victory was a singular success
on <num> october mack sent two columns out of ulm in preparation for a breakout to the north one under johann sigismund <unk> headed toward <unk> to secure the bridge there and the other under franz von <unk> went north with most of the heavy artillery
recognizing the opportunity marshal michel ney <unk> the rest of his vi corps forward to re @-@ establish contact with dupont who was still north of the <unk>
in a two @-@ pronged attack ney sent one division to the south of <unk> on the right bank of the <unk>
this division began the assault at <unk>
at the same time another division crossed the river to the east and moved west against <unk> 's position
after clearing austrian pickets from a bridge the french attacked and captured a strategically located abbey at the top of the hill at bayonet point
the austrian cavalry unsuccessfully tried to fend off the french but the austrian infantry broke and ran
in this engagement alone the austrians lost more than half their reserve artillery park <num> @,@ <num> out of <num> @,@ <num> total participants dead wounded or captured and four colors
<unk> 's column also failed to destroy the bridges across the <unk>
napoleon 's lightning campaign exposed the austrian indecisive command structure and poor supply apparatus
mack completely <unk> the french <unk> and scattered his forces as the french defeated each unit separately the surviving austrians withdrew toward the ulm fortifications
napoleon arrived to take personal command of close to <num> @,@ <num> men
at ulm on <num> october karl mack surrendered his encircled army of <num> @,@ <num> infantry and <num> @,@ <num> cavalry
the officers were released on the condition that they not serve against france until formally exchanged for french officers captured by the austrians an agreement to which they held
a russian army under gen
mikhail <unk> also maneuvered away from the french withdrawing to the east
at the ill river on <num> october it joined with the retreating austrian corps commanded by michael von <unk>
on <num> november the coalition forces held a successful rearguard action in <unk>
on <num> november the russians arrived in st
<unk> and crossed the <unk> river the next day
late on <num> november they destroyed the bridges across the <unk> holding the last one at the hamlet of stein near the village <unk> until the late afternoon
<num> mi down an old road lay <unk> with its small population of a few hundred at the confluence of the stream of that name and the <unk>
to the west of stein the <unk> made a large curve creating a crescent @-@ shaped floodplain between it and the mountains
at the far western end of the floodplain where the mountains came down almost to the river 's edge was <unk> with its castle known as <unk> <unk>
the castle had served as a prison for richard i of england in <num>
in <year> – <num> during the thirty years war the swedes had fortified the castle and then demolished it when they withdrew
it stands at <num> meters <num> ft on the highest ridge of a mountain <unk> with <unk> and pinnacles of granite
because the mountain was sparsely <unk> it was difficult to distinguish the ruins from the rocks
narrow canyons cut through the mountain and widen into the plain below
between <unk> and stein on the flood plain lay the hamlets of <unk> and <unk>
near the hamlets the <unk> flood plain was at its widest extending at the most <num> meters <num> @,@ <num> ft from the base of the <unk> mountain to the bank of the river
the region was known for its wine
since the <num> century the local inhabitants practiced viticulture and the wine producers formed st
paul vintners guild in <year> the oldest such guild in the german @-@ speaking world
terraced vineyards extended up the sides of the <unk> river until it became a mountain stream and terrain was unsuitable for cultivation
the <unk> plain supported both viticulture and agriculture
as the terrain became <unk> the vines grew in terraces built from the dark <unk> primordial rock
from <unk> to <unk> the river makes its wide curve the mountains and the steeply terraced slopes prevent clear line @-@ of @-@ sight between the two towns
consequently napoleon drew divisions from four of the other seven corps of the grande <unk> to create a new viii corps
this corps was to secure the north shore of the <unk> block any of the austrian or russian groups from reinforcing one another and more importantly prevent <unk> from crossing the river and escaping to russia
the new viii corps under the overall command of édouard <unk> included three infantry divisions and a division of cavalry see order of battle below
corps <unk> as it was known crossed the <unk> at linz and <unk> in early november <year> and marched east on the north bank of the <unk>
operating independently the corp 's cavalry conducted reconnaissance ahead of them and on the flanks
gen
<unk> 's division about <num> @,@ <num> men took the lead <unk> was with them
they were followed by gen
dupont 's division another <num> @,@ <num> about one day 's march behind
jean @-@ baptiste <unk> 's division another <num> @,@ <num> marching another day behind dupont brought up the rear
a flotilla of <num> boats acquired at <unk> provided communications across the <unk>
before sending <unk> on his mission napoleon instructed him to protect his north flank at all times against possible russian reinforcements advice he reiterated in subsequent written orders
napoleon also advised <unk> to secure all crossings of the <unk> between linz and vienna
on <num> november <unk> 's division reached <unk> an der <unk> and covered the <num> kilometers <num> mi to <unk> by early on the following afternoon
here it skirmished with some russian patrols to the east of the town and expelled them
feeling confident the french established a forward post just upstream from stein
in <unk> itself <unk> set up his command post and directed the establishment of a small field hospital
although the position seemed secure he had ignored napoleon 's strict instructions and neglected to protect his left north flank
this failure was an important factor when <unk> lost his corps so @-@ called eyes after he and <unk> had crossed the <unk> the french dragoons had veered to the northwest leaving only three squadrons of the <num> dragoons available for reconnaissance
these had left the division and were operating independently of <unk> 's command
consequently <unk> and <unk> marched blindly through the narrow canyon west of <unk> not knowing what lay ahead of them
<unk> had led the coalition army across the <unk> at <unk> a short distance past stein and destroyed the bridge behind him
his actions deprived the french commanders of a possible route across the <unk> putting the deployment of the entire french division at further risk in the case of retreat
in this decision <unk> abandoned vienna to the french who were converging on the austrian capital from the north west and southwest for the security of uniting with reinforcements from galicia
<unk> chose a military solution over a political one
unknown to either <unk> or <unk> the coalition had concentrated a force of approximately <num> @,@ <num> men mostly russians and a few austrians within a few kilometers of the french position at <unk>
in comparison <unk> 's division had only <num> @,@ <num> men
the austro @-@ russian force was a mixture of infantry jägers usually deployed as <unk> russian <unk> and russian and austrian cavalry accompanied by more than <num> artillery pieces
<unk> who had learned the military arts under the tutelage of the legendary russian <unk> <unk> had overall command
the russian cavalry units of the greatly feared cossacks were well @-@ suited for patrolling the river bank indeed on <num> november they had taken <num> french soldiers as prisoners
furthermore reinforcements stood in moravia less than two weeks march away
if the main body of the french army crossed the river they would require time to prepare
<unk> would have ample warning of any large @-@ scale french movement
after the afternoon 's initial skirmishing with the french <unk> held a council of war on the evening of <num> november at <unk> at the great abbey there
he knew several things
first he knew the positions of the french from prisoners his cossacks had captured
he also knew that <unk> had crossed at linz and was well ahead of any french reinforcements dupont had crossed at <unk> and by <num> november stood at <unk> <num> kilometers <num> mi upstream and <unk> was another <num> kilometers <num> mi further behind him
<unk> knew the size of the french <unk> division <unk> its positions and he knew that most of the dragoons were not covering the french flank but had turned north
he also knew or had made a good <unk> about napoleon 's orders so he knew what to offer <unk> and <unk> as bait
<unk> who had retired from the military in <year> had been recalled into service after the ulm debacle and had come to <unk> highly recommended by the emperor
he was an experienced <unk> and strategist and had served in a variety of posts in the habsburg military he had been archduke charles trusted adviser during the campaigns from <year> to <year> and had assisted in planning several of charles victories
upon his recall <unk> was appointed chief of the quartermaster general staff of the coalition army
the generals had found among the austrian force one capt
christoph freiherr von <unk> <year> – <year> who had knowledge of the local geography
together <unk> <unk> and the other generals with von <unk> 's advice on the local terrain <unk> a plan to encircle the french at <unk>
russian commander mikhail <unk> <unk> would approach <unk> 's division from the east supported by <unk> <unk> 's corps and pin the french in place
three additional columns commanded by <unk> <unk> <unk> maj
gen
<unk> and <unk> would outflank the french from the west and the north
they would offer as bait a rumor the russian army was retreating into moravia and only a rearguard would be left at <unk>
according to the plan in late morning <unk> 's column would emerge from the mountains first and launch a flanking assault on the french right
this flanking attack combined with <unk> 's frontal assault from stein would force the french into a <unk> encircled they would have no option but to <unk> die
to ensure the success of the plan the second and third columns under <unk> and <unk> would arrive in early and mid @-@ afternoon and support the earlier assaults
in this way even if the french tried to retreat west to <unk> they would not escape the <unk> @-@ like grip of the coalition army
<unk> accepted the bait of a rumored russian retreat
in the early morning of <num> november he and <unk> departed from <unk> to seize stein and <unk> presuming the russians had either abandoned the settlements or left only a small rear @-@ guard behind
as they approached stein a column of <unk> 's troops attacked the french forward positions
thinking this force was the rumored russian rear guard <unk> ordered gen
<unk> to counterattack and push east towards the town of stein
fighting spread though the villages of <unk> <unk> and the farm at <unk>
instead of withdrawing as a rear guard would more and more russian troops appeared and engaged the french column
initially <unk> made rapid progress but he quickly recognized that the opposing force was much stronger than the typical rear guard of a retreating army
realizing he had been <unk> and that <unk> 's troops were tiring rapidly <unk> sent orders to dupont 's division to hurry forward
by mid @-@ morning the french momentum had stalled <unk> committed most of his remaining forces to driving <unk> back leaving a single <unk> <num> <unk> cover his northern flank and sent the rest to attack the russian right
within <num> minutes he achieved the superiority of numbers he sought
his <num> @,@ <num> french opposed <num> @,@ <num> russians and forced them back toward stein while pressing an attack along the river
<unk> had no option for neither <unk> 's nor <unk> 's flanking columns were to be seen
at this stage of the battle fighting paused
<unk> and <unk> waited for dupont 's arrival while <unk> and <unk> waited for <unk> 's and <unk> 's
<unk> 's column was expected to be the last to join the fight because it had to march the greatest distance
the timing of the respite varies depending on whose reports are consulted fighting paused at around <num> <num> or <num> <num>
<unk> arrived first and immediately assaulted <unk> 's line with three battalions pushing the french out of <unk>
caught between two strong forces <unk> attempted to push his way back through <unk> to reach the river where the flotilla could evacuate his exhausted troops
withdrawing through the narrow <unk> canyon and fighting off the russian force at their rear <unk> and his division were trapped when more of <unk> 's russians appeared to block their retreat
the narrow defiles hampered the russians <unk> 's men had to march out of the canyons form ranks and attack in waves
despite <unk> 's continuous assault in the next two to three hours <unk> and <unk> pushed the russians back up the narrow <unk> in the hillside
at this point <unk> 's column appeared behind the french line and joined the battle
the french were outnumbered more than three to one assaulted in the front by <unk> 's column in the middle by <unk> 's and in the rear by <unk>
earlier in the morning dupont had proceeded with his column south and east along the river from <unk> according to instructions
even before the arrival of <unk> 's courier he heard the sound of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause
they came back to report that a russian column <unk> 's was descending from the mountains to take the road to <unk>
realizing this would separate him from the forward division dupont <unk> his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take the russians in the flank
the french assault heralded by cannon fire caused <unk> 's troops to turn their attention from <unk> 's beleaguered force to face these new assailants
although superior in numbers <unk> 's column had no supporting artillery and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size
it was <unk> 's turn to face attackers at his front and rear until the arrival of <unk> 's column which had <unk> its way through the mountains in the west
<unk> arrived at dusk and the action continued well after dark in mid @-@ november night falls at close to <num> <num> in the upper <unk> <unk>
despite the darkness <unk> descended out of the defiles and deployed his troops to <unk> dupont 's flank
as his russians entered the fray they came between a battalion of french and another of russians
with the additional force the french were overwhelmed but most of the shooting subsided when the combatants could not tell apart friend from foe in the dark
under the cover of darkness <unk> used the french flotilla to evacuate his exhausted troops to the south bank
the french and russians continued to <unk> <unk> into the night as sentries encountered one another in the dark
portions of <unk> 's force provided any necessary rear guard action and the following morning the remaining men were evacuated from the north shore of the <unk> while they maintained possession of only <unk> and <unk> on the north bank
aside from losing five guns <num> officers and <num> men under his command were captured bringing the loss of <unk> closer to <num> percent furthermore he lost the eagles of the <num> infantry regiment france and the eagle and <unk> of the <num> dragoons
the russians lost around <num> @,@ <num> about <num> percent of their force and two regimental colors
the austrian lieutenant field marshal <unk> was killed as the battle concluded probably by russian <unk> in the confused melee
the vineyards and the villages of <unk> and <unk> were destroyed as was most of <unk> and stein
<unk> was heavily damaged the french plundered the town at least twice and <unk> handled its inhabitants
although losses were fairly equal in terms of <unk> wounded or dead on each <unk> coalition forces went into battle with <num> @,@ <num> men while the french started with <unk> 's division of about <num> @,@ <num> which grew close to <num> @,@ <num> when dupont 's men joined the fighting in the afternoon
regardless <unk> 's division was nearly destroyed the <num> percent losses experienced by the french fell predominantly on his division
clearly for both sides the fighting was hard
the weather had been cold an early storm had left slick icy mud in the roadways and <unk> like chandeliers hung from the trees
for the coalition the russians were secure on the north bank of the <unk> awaiting reinforcements from galicia the bridges between linz and vienna had been destroyed making french access to the austrian capital more difficult but not impossible
after six months of fighting in which the austrians had enjoyed little good news the coalition could claim a difficult and timely victory
the french had retreated from the field with a badly mauled division and <unk> had secured the right flank
indeed francis was so pleased with the outcome at <unk> that he awarded <unk> the military order of maria theresa
for the french the survival of the corps <unk> seemed nothing short of a miracle
the remainder of <unk> 's division crossed the river the next morning and eventually <unk> in vienna which the french acquired by deception later in the month
more importantly for them the french force had performed well over difficult terrain and under terrible combat conditions
initially there had been some panic and parts of at least one french battalion had tried to escape on the flotilla craft
they had lost control of the boats in the current and smashed into the pillars of the burned bridge at <unk> overturning their boats
tossed into the icy river most had drowned
despite this initial panic <unk> 's column retained its cohesion and responded well to various difficult demands
dupont had demonstrated his tactical acumen when he heard cannon fire he directed his troops toward it to support the french division
in terms of french staffing <unk> 's failure to guard his flank especially in the face of napoleon 's direct advice adversely influenced his relationship with his commander
however in the immediate weeks ahead the flamboyant <unk> did more to annoy napoleon than <unk> had
in assessing the battle and its aftermath historians have laid the blame and credit for its outcome not only on <unk> and <unk> napoleon aware of <unk> 's danger and his own culpability for it vented his frustration on <unk> whom he unjustly accused of abandoning <unk> for the empty glory of riding through vienna
after the victory at <unk> napoleon dispersed the viii corps and reassigned <unk>
however disappointed he may have been with <unk> napoleon was pleased with <unk> 's performance
as recognition of his conduct in what the french called the immortal battle of <unk> <unk> received the officer 's grand cross of the legion of honor
the loss of <unk> was a significant blow to the austrian military organization
called out of retirement for this specific task he was one of their most experienced general staff officers other than the archduke charles
from the summer of <year> until his retirement in <year> he had been chief of the quartermaster general staff of the army the lower rhine the rhine and the army of germany
furthermore he was a trusted member of archduke charles staff
he had helped to design several of charles more important victories at <unk> <unk> the sieges at <unk> and <unk> the battles at <unk> and <unk> and the northern swiss campaign of <year> that included battles at <unk> and zürich
an experienced officer and excellent <unk> he might well have made a more effective chief of the quartermaster general staff of the coalition army at the battle of <unk> than his eventual replacement franz von <unk>
in <unk> 's absence <unk> the architect of the austrian catastrophe at <unk> in <year> was chosen to develop the general battle plan of coalition action at <unk>
<unk> undoubtedly a far better <unk> than <unk> and possessed of superior training and mapping skills would have developed a more realistic coalition plan for <unk>
<unk> 's presence would probably not have been enough to turn that defeat into a victory but it would have mitigated the magnitude of the coalition 's losses <unk> was considered one of napoleon 's finest triumphs
in the broader picture despite the important major naval engagements the outcome of the war of the third coalition was determined on the continent predominantly in the two major land operations
in the ulm campaign the habsburgs achieved some minor victories such as <unk> 's at <unk> @-@ <unk> but ultimately lost an entire army and an officer corps
the latter would not resume arms against france until formally exchanged
this condition crippled the austrian military leadership and forced the recall of such pensioners as <unk> out of retirement
after the capitulation at ulm isolated portions of the austrian military evaded capture and joined with their russian allies michael von <unk> 's corps slipped out of the encirclement and joined <unk> 's force
a few other small forces refused to <unk> and seemingly melted into the bavarian mountains and the <unk> forests to reappear in bohemia for <unk>
sixteen hundred cavalry including archduke ferdinand and prince <unk> broke out of ulm before its capitulation
maximilian count of <unk> led his column back through the mountains into austria fighting rear guard actions against pursuing french forces at the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
these elusive units were insufficient to balance heavy losses at key battles in which the austrians could not hold their own against the french
between the ulm capitulation and the austrian and russian defeat at <unk> there were other minor achievements a successful <unk> between the cavalry that escaped from ulm and the french near the town of <unk> the contested victory at <unk> and another within days at <unk>
the second determining event the decisive french victory at the battle of <unk> over the combined russian and austrian armies forced the austrian withdrawal from the coalition
the subsequent peace of <unk> signed on <num> december <year> reinforced the earlier treaties of campo <unk> and <unk>
furthermore austria ceded land to napoleon 's german allies and paid an indemnity of <num> million francs
victory at <unk> also gave napoleon the latitude to create a buffer zone of german states between france and the states of prussia russia and austria
these measures did not establish a lasting peace on the continent
prussian worries about growing french influence in central europe sparked the war of the fourth coalition in <year> in which austria did not participate
in <year> during the war of the austrian succession several hundred local villagers had held off the french and bavarian armies intent on capturing vienna by painting drain pipes to look like cannons and beating on drums thus suggesting the presence of a large force
after <year> the exploits of <num> @,@ <num> french russian and austrian soldiers excited the european imagination
general <unk> 's grave has never been found but in <year> a monument for him was erected at the stein tor the gate leading from the old village of <unk> to the hamlet of stein
the house in which captain von <unk> lived was marked with a bronze plate commemorating his contribution to the battle
in <year> a spanish <unk> created an image of the battle which was later expanded by english <unk> john outhwaite
the image depicts the evacuation of french troops via the <unk> flotilla see <unk> image on a <unk> night
in fact the moon was in its last quarter phase <num> hours later and on <num> november probably did not provide as much light as depicted in the image

in the russian novel war and peace leo <unk> devoted several pages to the battle its prelude and its aftermath and the delivery of its news to the tsar by prince andrew

brock has wrestled his entire professional career in the wwe and we are proud of his accomplishments and wish him the best in his new endeavor
<unk> later told a minnesota radio show that he had three wonderful years in wwe but had grown unhappy and always wanted to play pro football adding that he did not want to be <num> years old and wondering if he could have made it in football
in an interview about the nfl he stated this is no load of bull it 's no wwe stunt
i am dead serious about this
i ain 't afraid of anything and i ain 't afraid of anybody
i 've been an underdog in athletics since i was five
i got zero college offers for wrestling
now people say i can 't play football that it 's a joke
i say i can
i 'm as good an athlete as a lot of guys in the nfl if not better
i 've always had to fight for everything
i wasn 't the best technician in amateur wrestling but i was strong had great conditioning and a hard head
nobody could break me
as long as i have that i don 't give a damn what anybody else thinks

in addition to mononucleosis it was revealed that he was suffering from a serious case of <unk> an intestinal disorder which required surgery
after further diagnosis <unk> underwent surgery on november <num> to close a <unk> in his intestine that had been leaking <unk> matter into his abdomen causing pain <unk> and <unk> his immune system to the point that he contracted mononucleosis
from the level of damage to <unk> 's system the surgeon estimated that the intestinal condition had been ongoing for around a year

they are the original and simplest filters produced by this methodology and consist of a ladder network of identical sections of passive components
historically they are the first filters that could approach the ideal filter frequency response to within any prescribed limit with the addition of a sufficient number of sections
however they are rarely considered for a modern design the principles behind them having been superseded by other methodologies which are more accurate in their prediction of filter response
he published his work in <year> but had clearly invented the filters some time before as his colleague at at t co otto <unk> was already making improvements to the design at this time
campbell 's filters were far superior to the simpler single element circuits that had been used previously
campbell called his filters electric wave filters but this term later came to mean any filter that passes waves of some frequencies but not others
many new forms of wave filter were subsequently invented an early and important variation was the m @-@ derived filter by <unk> who coined the term constant k for the campbell filter in order to distinguish them
the great advantage campbell 's filters had over the <unk> circuit and other simple filters of the time was that they could be designed for any desired degree of stop band rejection or <unk> of transition between pass band and stop band
it was only necessary to add more filter sections until the desired response was obtained
the filters were designed by campbell for the purpose of separating <unk> telephone channels on transmission lines but their subsequent use has been much more widespread than that
the design techniques used by campbell have largely been superseded
however the ladder <unk> used by campbell with the constant k is still in use today with implementations of modern filter designs such as the <unk> filter
campbell gave constant k designs for low @-@ pass high @-@ pass and band @-@ pass filters
band @-@ stop and multiple band filters are also possible
image theory defines quantities in terms of an infinite cascade of two @-@ port sections and in the case of the filters being discussed an infinite ladder network of l @-@ sections
here l should not be confused with the <unk> l – in electronic filter <unk> l refers to the specific filter shape which resembles inverted letter l
the sections of the hypothetical infinite filter are made of series elements having impedance <unk> and shunt elements with admittance <unk>
the factor of two is introduced for mathematical convenience since it is usual to work in terms of half @-@ sections where it disappears
the image impedance of the input and output port of a section will generally not be the same
however for a mid @-@ series section that is a section from halfway through a series element to halfway through the next series element will have the same image impedance on both ports due to symmetry
this image impedance is designated <unk> due to the t <unk> of a mid @-@ series section
likewise the image impedance of a mid @-@ shunt section is designated <unk> due to the <unk> <unk>
half of such a t or <unk> section is called a half @-@ section which is also an l @-@ section but with half the element values of the full l @-@ section
the image impedance of the half @-@ section is dissimilar on the input and output ports on the side presenting the series element it is equal to the mid @-@ series <unk> but on the side presenting the shunt element it is equal to the mid @-@ shunt <unk>
there are thus two variant ways of using a half @-@ section
parts of this article or section rely on the reader 's knowledge of the complex impedance representation of <unk> and <unk> and on knowledge of the frequency domain representation of signals
the k in constant k is the value given by <formula> thus k will have units of impedance that is <unk>
it is readily apparent that in order for k to be constant y must be the dual impedance of z
a physical interpretation of k can be given by observing that k is the limiting value of zi as the size of the section in terms of values of its components such as <unk> <unk> etc
approaches zero while keeping k at its initial value
thus k is the characteristic impedance <unk> of the transmission line that would be formed by these <unk> small sections
it is also the image impedance of the section at resonance in the case of band @-@ pass filters or at ω <num> in the case of low @-@ pass filters
for example the pictured low @-@ pass half @-@ section has <formula>
elements l and c can be made arbitrarily small while retaining the same value of k
z and y however are both approaching zero and from the formulae below for image <unk> <formula>
this prototype can be impedance scaled and frequency scaled to the desired values
the low @-@ pass prototype can also be transformed into high @-@ pass band @-@ pass or band @-@ stop types by application of suitable frequency transformations
like impedance must always face like in these combinations
there are therefore two circuits that can be formed with two identical l @-@ shaped half @-@ sections
where a port of image impedance <unk> faces another <unk> the section is called a <unk> section
where <unk> faces <unk> the section so formed is a t section
further additions of half @-@ sections to either of these section forms a ladder network which may start and end with series or shunt elements
it should be borne in mind that the characteristics of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image impedance
this is usually not true of the sections at either end which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance
the further the section is from the end of the filter the more accurate the prediction will become since the effects of the terminating <unk> are masked by the intervening sections
it is the eighth christmas special since the show 's <year> revival and the first to be within a series
it was written by head writer and executive producer steven moffat and directed by saul <unk>
the episode is set in the victorian era and sees the doctor matt smith brooding with the assistance of silurian madame <unk> neve <unk> her wife jenny flint <unk> stewart and <unk> <unk> dan starkey after the loss of companions amy pond and rory williams in the previous episode the angels take manhattan
he is forced out of hiding to investigate mysterious sentient <unk> that are building themselves and meets clara oswald jenna @-@ louise coleman a governess also investigating the <unk>
they discover that the <unk> are being animated by the great intelligence voice of ian <unk> with the help of a man named dr <unk> richard e
grant
building upon the character 's surprise introduction in asylum of the daleks the <unk> introduces clara as the doctor 's new companion though ultimately it would be a third version of her character that would travel with the doctor starting with the bells of saint john
in addition to clara the <unk> also introduces a redesigned <unk> revised title sequence and theme music and sees changes to the doctor 's costume
the special was produced in august <year> with location filming in newport wales and bristol
it received final ratings of <num>
<num> million viewers in the uk becoming the fourth most @-@ watched programme of christmas day
the <unk> was met with mostly positive reviews from critics most of whom received the introduction and character of clara well
however some felt that grant and <unk> were <unk> as villains or the plot was slight because of the focus on characterisation
the first was broadcast during the <year> children in need telethon on <num> november <year> titled the great detective
the silurian madame <unk> her human wife jenny flint and the <unk> <unk> all returning from a good man goes to war describe a number of strange phenomena to a shadowed fourth detective
the fourth detective reveals himself to be the doctor and tells the group that he has retired
a second prequel titled <unk> investigates was released online on <num> december <year>
at the end of a case <unk> and jenny converse with an officer from scotland yard and apologise for <unk> 's violent wishes for the culprit 's punishment
<unk> explains <unk> 's alien origin as well as her own to the officer much to his astonishment
<unk> reveals that she was <unk> by an extension to the london underground and initially disliked humans though that changed when she fell in love with jenny
on the carriage ride home jenny notices it is beginning to snow and <unk> notes that the snow should be impossible because there are no clouds in the sky
a third prequel titled the battle of demon 's run — two days later was released on the united states itunes and amazon video stores on <num> march <year>
two days after the events of a good man goes to war <unk> and jenny convince <unk> that he is not mortally wounded and invite him to accompany them back to <num> london
the scene had been filmed as an extra due to the anticipation that fans would ask how <unk> was resurrected and came to be in <unk> 's employ
the snowman starts speaking to the boy repeating his assertions that the other children are silly
fifty years later the boy has grown up to be dr
walter <unk> proprietor of the great intelligence institute
he hires men to collect samples of snow which he places in a large snow @-@ filled globe in his laboratory before feeding the men to a group of animated <unk>
the doctor still despondent after losing his former companions amy pond and rory williams has parked his <unk> above victorian london among the clouds
he uses his allies <unk> jenny and <unk> to keep people away from him
they also fill their time investigating mysteries throughout the city
elsewhere barmaid clara <unk> oswald investigates a disturbance outside the tavern she works at and finds the doctor walking by
he attempts to leave discreetly but clara follows him to a coach
not wishing to become involved in matters the doctor instructs <unk> to bring him a memory worm that will erase the last hour of clara 's memories with just a touch
before they can do so they are surrounded by <unk> created from snow with psychic properties who attack the group
the doctor realises that clara 's thoughts are creating the <unk> and ends the threat by instructing her to think of them melting
clara cautions the doctor that if he wipes her memory she will forget how to deal with the <unk>
the doctor reluctantly allows her to go and ascends a staircase to the sky to return to the <unk>
clara follows him and knocks on the door but she hides and flees down the staircase when the doctor answers
clara returns to her other job as governess for the children of captain latimer
she learns that latimer 's daughter has been having horrible dreams about their previous governess returning from the dead
clara realises that the pond that contains the old governess body is the only thing still frozen around them
she attempts to track down the doctor but instead attracts the attention of jenny who takes her to see <unk>
<unk> tells clara she gets only one word to impress the doctor with if she wants his help
clara chooses the word pond which shocks the doctor and <unk> his interest
acting on a tip from <unk> the doctor visits the great intelligence institute posing as sherlock holmes
he confronts dr
<unk> and find a large glass globe in <unk> 's office that contains psychic snow
the doctor speaks to the great intelligence the entity that has been speaking to dr
<unk> since he was a boy
he learns that the great intelligence has been controlling the <unk> and has taken interest in latimer 's pond
the doctor visits the pond and deduces that the great intelligence is using the old governess body as a dna blueprint to form an ice creature that will retain its form and not melt
while clara is putting the children to bed the frozen body of the governess breaks into the house
the doctor fights her off and is joined by <unk> jenny and <unk>
dr
<unk> arrives with more <unk> and tells them he wants the governess ice body
the doctor flees with clara to the roof of the mansion and then to the <unk> <unk> overhead
they are pursued by the ice governess whom the doctor traps under a layer of frozen ice crystals
inside the <unk> the doctor gives clara a <unk> key but the ice governess arrives and pulls clara down off the cloud
the doctor picks up clara and takes her back to latimer 's mansion placing her under medical care of <unk>
he collects the ice fragments from the governess and places them in a souvenir london underground biscuit tin
he and <unk> travel to <unk> 's lab where the doctor notes the intelligence 's plan to replace humanity with ice creatures and holds up the tin with the necessary dna
dr <unk> grabs the tin and opens it only to find the memory worm which <unk> on to him
the doctor states that the great intelligence which has been existing as a mirror of dr <unk> 's thoughts will vanish with the <unk> of <unk> 's memories
instead the intelligence reveals that it existed long enough that it can now control <unk> 's body which it uses to attack <unk> and the doctor
the influence of the great intelligence quickly <unk> and <unk> falls dead
outside a salt @-@ water rain has started and the doctor sees that another psychic ability has taken control of the snow from the great intelligence the latimer family crying for clara
<unk> informs the doctor upon his return to the latimer mansion that clara only has moments left and she passes away as the doctor returns the <unk> key to her
at her funeral the doctor reads clara 's full name on her tombstone and realises she is the woman he met in asylum of the daleks who became a dalek whom he refers to as <unk> girl
he gleefully announces that a person dying twice is an impossibility and bidding farewell to his allies for now the doctor departs in the <unk> to investigate and find clara
the episode concludes in contemporary times where a young woman resembling clara walks through the same graveyard pausing by clara 's tombstone
in these stories the great intelligence uses robot <unk> as its physical presence
the events of the web of fear are alluded to by the doctor in the <unk> when he presents the london underground biscuit tin to the great intelligence in dr <unk> 's laboratory the intelligence states i do not understand these markings in reference to the <year> london underground map design on the tin
the doctor remarks that the underground is a key strategic weakness in metropolitan living referring to and possibly setting in motion the future <unk> attack on london via the underground
coleman previously played <unk> oswald in asylum of the daleks though the connection between the two characters is not clarified until clara reveals she has an interest in <unk> a trait that <unk> 's character also had
the doctor after meeting clara <unk> replies those were the days when she asks why he isn 't staying to get acquainted with her which are the same words he tells craig owens closing time when craig comments that the doctor always wins
the final scenes at the graveyard establish that clara shares the same name as <unk> leading the doctor to <unk> they are the same person
as seen on her gravestone clara 's birthdate is <num> november the date doctor who was first transmitted in <year>
the story would also show how the doctor had responded to losing his previous companions moffat said that i think he 's probably reached the point in his life where he 's saying friendship for me is just postponed <unk> — i want to be on my own for a while
moffat compared the withdrawn doctor seen at the onset of the episode to the first appearances of the first doctor william <unk> in <year> and the ninth doctor christopher eccleston in <year>
he also attributed the idea of a retired doctor to a plot proposed by douglas adams in the <num> but rejected by the production team at the time
continuing the theme introduced with the series first five episodes the <unk> was promoted like a movie
a movie poster was released in the radio times showing the doctor and clara ascending the ladder to the <unk>
the episode saw several major design changes for the series
the <unk> is the debut of a redesigned <unk> interior as well as a new title sequence and variation of the theme tune
the new title sequence features a brief glimpse of the doctor 's face the first time since survival the final serial of the classic series in <year> that the doctor 's face has been seen in the title sequence
moffat had noticed that the <unk> design was getting progressively whimsical and resembled more of a magical place rather than a machine
it was designed by series production designer michael <unk> who stated that the new interior was also supposed to be darker and moodier and provide an easier access to the gallery of the ship when shooting
the doctor also wears a one @-@ off costume victorian @-@ themed which smith described as a bit artful dodger meets the doctor
moffat described the new outfit as a progression as the doctor was in a different phase of his life now and felt more grown @-@ up and <unk>
the costume was designed by howard burden for this episode
the <unk> also contains several references to sherlock holmes including the doctor dressing up as him
moffat is co @-@ creator of the bbc series sherlock for which smith auditioned for the role of doctor watson before being cast as the doctor
in addition the incidental music during the scene bears a resemblance to the sherlock theme
coleman was cast because of her chemistry with matt smith and especially because she was able to talk faster than him
she auditioned for the role of clara not <unk> from asylum as the concept of the two characters being the same only occurred to moffat whilst casting for clara
the production team requested that the press and fans who attended advanced screenings keep coleman 's appearance a secret until asylum was broadcast the effort was ultimately successful
moffat stated that the introduction of a new companion made the show feel different and brought the story to a new beginning with a different person meeting the doctor
smith said that clara was different from her predecessor amy pond karen <unk> which allowed the audience to see a different side of the doctor
coleman described her as resourceful and not intimidated citing the reason for following the doctor at the beginning as pursuing answers
the clara who would become a travelling companion of the doctor would not debut until the spring premiere the bells of saint john save for a brief cameo at the end of the <unk>
coleman stated that she played each version as individuals with trust that there would be a payoff to her mystery
also returning to the series are neve <unk> as madame <unk> dan starkey as <unk> and <unk> stewart as jenny
all three previously appeared in a good man goes to war and reprised their roles both in this episode and in the prequels
they returned due to the popularity of <unk> and jenny moffat considered a spin @-@ off featuring them though he did not have the time to do it
instead he decided to bring them back in the main series

grant had previously played the doctor on two occasions as an alternative tenth doctor in the spoof charity special doctor who and the curse of fatal death which was written by moffat and as an alternative ninth doctor in the animated story scream of the <unk> which had been intended to be a continuation of the series before it was revived in <year>
smith commented that grant was born to be a who villain
he pitches it on that perfect level and tone
grant 's appearance in doctor who was teased by the bbc via twitter announcing his appearance at midnight <num> august <year>
tom ward was drawn to his role because of the quality of the script and also stated his young children were pleased that he appeared in the programme
the great intelligence was voiced by sir ian <unk>
the two children clara is governess to <unk> and francesca were played by real @-@ life brother and sister joseph and ellie <unk> @-@ alden
the read @-@ through had taken place on <num> august <year>
this was the first christmas special to be filmed in bbc wales new <unk> lock studios
scenes featuring coleman and several guest stars in a victorian setting were filmed in newport wales while coleman and smith were also spotted filming in bristol two weeks later on <num> august
some scenes which used snow props were filmed in portland square bristol where filming took place overnight on <num> – <num> august <year>
bristol was chosen because it had victorian @-@ era architecture
<unk> stated that his favourite set is the london street with the back of the pub which he said was based on a sixteenth @-@ century building in oxford
the locations were blocked off and sprayed with fake snow
the <unk> on the cloud was achieved through a mix of fog on the studio floor and post @-@ production special effects
director saul <unk> explained that it was difficult to achieve the desired look for the <unk> the first ones he likened to <unk> from rainbow which was too cute of an appearance and so the effects team created more menacing cgi faces
clara 's introduction to the <unk> introduced two novel effects for the show
the first was a single @-@ shot camera tracking from a few feet away from the <unk> to its interior with the implication of the <unk> 's trans @-@ dimensional nature shown to the audience
in the following shot the camera does a complete circle of the <unk> console an effect not seen since the early days of the show
<unk> wanted to include this shot to further emphasize the bigger on the inside than the outside nature of the time machine
in addition to the three prequel mini @-@ episodes the cast also filmed an additional promotional video <unk> carols which the bbc uploaded during the days leading up to the broadcast
the video featured starkey singing modified versions of several christmas songs in character as <unk> as his <unk> look on before everyone breaks character and begins laughing
uk overnight ratings showed that the special had been watched by <num>
<num> million viewers coming in sixth for the night
final consolidated figures not including bbc iplayer viewers showed that the episode was watched by <num>
<num> million viewers coming in fourth for the night
it also received an appreciation index figure of <num> higher than most of the doctor who christmas specials
the iplayer version had <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> views making it the most popular tv show on iplayer over christmas
the us airing was seen by <num>
<num> million viewers with a <num>
<num> rating in the demographic of adults aged <num> – <num>
dan martin of the guardian called it actually the best christmas special since the christmas invasion and the first to be actually scary with everything we like about doctor who and christmas
he praised coleman 's introduction as clara and the gang of <unk> jenny and <unk>
ign 's matt <unk> gave the <unk> a score of <num>
<num> out of <num> describing it as a <unk> riveting <unk> in storytelling which refreshingly lacked traditional christmas references in favour of some sparkling dialogue gorgeous set design and fascinating characterisation
while he felt that grant and <unk> were <unk> he was very positive towards coleman 's unpredictable clara
radio times reviewer patrick <unk> was pleased with the return of the great intelligence despite an inconsistency in the timeline he found and praised the lovely images and direction of the special though he felt the variation of the theme music lacks the menace of the original
while he was positive towards clara he was unmoved by her death as it was plainly silly that she did not look injured
nick <unk> of sfx gave the special four and a half out of five stars writing that the power of emotion saves the day again was appropriate in light of the festivities and many fairytales referenced in the story
<unk> was positive towards the terrific comedy with <unk> coleman and the surprisingly <unk> grant as well as the new title sequence and <unk>
while he wrote that the subtle <unk> of the great intelligence was a <unk> more interesting than the usual so we meet again schtick he ultimately felt their threat never quite comes into sharp relief
<unk> <unk> of the independent wrote that the <unk> was stronger than the previous year 's the doctor the widow and the wardrobe as it was connected to the overall story of the series but still has a way to go if it is to live up to a christmas carol
despite feeling that it was enjoyable she noted that the story feels truncated and rushed the mirror 's jon cooper also praised coleman and the new side of the doctor that was shown comparing it to rose tyler billie piper challenging the ninth doctor christopher eccleston
however he felt the character @-@ heavy story was to the <unk> of the plot which was a classic who set @-@ up that ultimately suffers from a lack of explanation and more set @-@ pieces than a coherent whole
he felt that the episode may not have been accessible for casual viewers but offered much for fans in time for the programme 's fiftieth anniversary
dominic cavendish of the daily telegraph gave the <unk> three out of five stars disappointed that it was not as scary as it had been hyped to be
while he was positive towards smith and the <unk> on the cloud he criticised <unk> and the <unk> @-@ like complexity of the script
the episode was nominated for the <year> hugo award for best dramatic presentation short form alongside asylum of the daleks and the angels take manhattan but lost to the game of thrones episode <unk>
it was later included as part of the dvd blu @-@ ray box set doctor who the complete seventh series in september <year>
it has subsequently been reissued in several box set compilations most recently alongside the christmas specials between the christmas invasion and last christmas inclusive in a boxset titled doctor who – the <num> christmas specials on <num> october <year>
<num> squadron raaf no
<num> squadron is a royal australian air force raaf support squadron
coming under the control of no
<num> wing it is responsible for the management of the airfield at raaf base <unk> south australia
the squadron originated as a maritime patrol unit during world war ii
raised in august <year> it operated pby catalina and short empire flying boats from bases in new guinea queensland and the northern territory conducting search @-@ and @-@ rescue mine @-@ laying anti @-@ submarine and bombing missions against japanese targets in the pacific theatre
following the conclusion of hostilities the squadron was disbanded in march <year>
it was reactivated as an airfield support squadron in april <year>
<num> squadron was formed at port moresby new guinea on <num> august <year> for a general reconnaissance role under the command of squadron leader w
n
gibson
its establishment was six pby catalina flying boats and <num> personnel but only five aircraft all transferred from no
<num> squadron and <num> personnel were available initially
the squadron conducted long @-@ range patrols between bases scattered around the islands to australia 's north in conjunction with no
<num> squadron
on <num> november no
<num> squadron 's catalinas were augmented by two short empire flying boats transferred from no
<num> squadron
on <num> november <year> following the loss of hmas sydney one of no
<num> squadron 's catalinas was despatched to western australia to join a no
<num> squadron catalina in search @-@ and @-@ rescue missions but they found only oil <unk>
by the outbreak of war in the pacific no
<num> squadron had a strength of six catalinas and two empire flying boats
its personnel at the beginning of december numbered <num> officers and <num> men
the squadron undertook its first sortie of the pacific war on <num> december a catalina located three japanese <unk> in the vicinity of thursday island queensland
later in the month it commenced anti @-@ submarine patrols and in january <year> bombing raids against japanese bases
as the japanese advanced into the south west pacific no
<num> squadron was also responsible for evacuating white civilians from areas threatened by invasion
on <num> january one of its catalinas located the japanese fleet steaming for rabaul and signalled a warning to the town 's australian defenders before being shot down by anti @-@ aircraft fire it was the squadron 's first combat loss
in the wake of the fall of rabaul the catalinas of nos
<num> and <num> squadrons became the raaf 's only offensive weapon against the japanese
their raids on rabaul did little to stem the japanese advance and in the following months port moresby itself was subjected to increasingly frequent attacks which destroyed aircraft facilities and squadron records
in february <year> the short empires operated by nos
<num> and <num> squadrons were transferred to the newly formed no
<num> transport squadron
no
<num> squadron lost two catalinas during patrols on <num> and <num> may the nine crewmen of the first were later found to have been captured and beheaded the crew of the second were also captured and subsequently disappeared without trace
in response to the threat of invasion at port moresby nos
<num> and <num> squadrons moved to bowen queensland on <num> may <year>
they were soon attacking japanese targets in lae <unk> and rabaul
on <num> june each squadron contributed an aircraft to a four @-@ hour raid over lae and <unk> during which as well as bombs the raaf crews dropped beer bottles to disrupt the enemy soldiers sleep — the sound they made falling through the air was according to the official history something between a shrill whistle and a scream
by <num> july no
<num> squadron 's strength was six catalinas and <num> personnel out of a planned establishment of nine aircraft and <num> personnel
its prime responsibility in early <year> was maritime reconnaissance as far as new guinea the solomon islands and new caledonia the latter half of the year saw a greater focus on night bombing
now comprising <num> officers and men the squadron relocated to cairns on <num> november <year>
from cairns it continued to conduct reconnaissance anti @-@ submarine and occasional bombing operations over the waters around new guinea
between december <year> and march <year> no
<num> squadron 's aircraft flew a total of <num> @,@ <num> hours and dropped <num> tons of bombs
the squadron 's role changed in june <year> when it commenced mine @-@ laying operations over the netherlands east indies and the philippines though it continued to make some bombing raids and supply drops
in september <year> no
<num> squadron became part of no
<num> wing raaf along with nos
<num> and <num> squadrons and moved to darwin northern territory
all three squadrons operated catalinas their primary purpose being mine @-@ laying
on the night of <num> september a catalina of no
<num> squadron was shot down while attacking a ship at <unk> in the dutch east indies the loss was compounded by the fact that one of the <unk> of the mining campaign lieutenant commander p
e
carr of the royal australian navy was aboard the plane and was captured by the japanese
another of the squadron 's catalinas went down on the night of <num> <num> january <year> possibly in a cyclone over the timor sea during the campaign to mine surabaya
in march a detachment of four no
<num> squadron aircraft along with four from no
<num> squadron laid mines off the coast of southern china and <unk> as part of a no
<num> wing offensive in this area these operations were conducted from leyte gulf in the philippines
one of no
<num> squadron 's catalinas was lost on the night of <num> <num> march most likely owing to bad weather rather than enemy action
three of the squadron 's aircraft mined the entrance to hong kong harbour on <num> april and on <num> may four of its catalinas mined <unk> harbour in china the furthest north that any australian aircraft infiltrated during the war in the pacific
three of its aircraft flew the raaf 's last mine @-@ laying mission on <num> july
no
<num> squadron 's final wartime sortie was a patrol on <num> august <year>
following the end of the war the squadron operated in the transport role and ferried australian prisoners of war home from various locations in south east asia
it relocated to raaf station <unk> new south wales on <num> november
no
<num> squadron flew its last mission a transport flight to balikpapan on <num> january <year> and disbanded at <unk> on <num> march
<num> squadron was reactivated on <num> april <year> to support airfield operations at raaf base <unk> south australia
consisting of nine uniformed personnel and one australian public service member under the command of squadron leader simon bartlett the squadron formed part of no
<num> wing a component of combat support group <unk>
the airfield had previously been managed under the auspices of <unk> operational support group but a command @-@ and @-@ control review commissioned by the chief of air force recommended that in common with other raaf airfields it should be administered by <unk>
raaf base <unk> incorporating <unk> village was one of two air force units formally established on <num> january <year> as part of a reorganisation of the <unk> range complex the other unit being raaf <unk> test range
the design of the reactivated squadron 's crest includes a wedge @-@ tailed eagle to denote courage and nobility a <unk> spear thrower to symbolise the town and its indigenous heritage sturt 's desert pea to represent south australia and the <unk> star cluster which features in the folklore of the local <unk> people
the <unk> was originally designed as the latest in the line of light tanks built by the company for the british army
it improved upon its predecessor the mk <unk> light tank by introducing the extra firepower of a <num> @-@ pounder gun
the war office ordered <num> tanks an order that eventually increased to <num>
production was delayed by several factors and as a consequence only <num> to <num> of the tanks were produced
the tank 's design flaws combined with the decision by the war office not to use light tanks in british armoured divisions ruled out the use of <unk> in the north african campaign
as a result the majority of the tanks remained in britain although <num> were sent to the ussr as part of the lend @-@ lease program
in early <year> the royal armoured corps formed three squadrons for use in overseas amphibious operations one of which was equipped with <unk>
in may <year> a small number of <unk> formed part of the british force which participated in the invasion of madagascar and in june <year> <unk> were attached to the 1st airborne division after it was decided that the design allowed its use as an air @-@ portable light tank to support british airborne forces
the <unk> were transported and landed in specially designed general aircraft <unk> gliders
a lack of gliders prevented their participation in the allied invasion of sicily in <year> instead they were attached to the new <num> airborne division and became part of the <num> airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment
the division used approximately <num> <unk> during the british airborne landings in normandy in june <year>
the tanks were successfully landed by glider but they did not perform well
several were lost in accidents and those that did see action proved to be inferior in firepower and armour to the armoured fighting vehicles of the german forces
a few days after the beginning of the operation the tanks were removed from direct engagement with german armour and used only to provide fire support
by august <year> most of the <unk> in action were replaced with cromwell cruiser tanks and the remainder were replaced by the <num> <unk> in december <year>
<unk> did not see any further combat and were deemed obsolete by <year> the last was retired in <year>
there were several variations on the <unk> design including the <unk> self @-@ propelled gun and the light tank mk viii but none of these were ever used in active service with the british army
it was to be the latest in a series of light tanks produced by the company
the tank was designed to overcome the shortcomings of insufficient armament in earlier light tanks that were fitted only with machine guns
vickers @-@ armstrong installed on the mk <unk> a <num> @-@ pounder <num> @-@ millimetre <num>
<num> in main gun paired with a <num>
<num> @-@ millimetre <num>
<num> in <unk> machine gun and mounted the two guns in a two @-@ man turret
the tank possessed a maximum of <num> millimetres <num>
<num> in of armour
the prototype weighed approximately <num> @,@ <num> pounds <num> @,@ <num> kg and was powered by a <num> @-@ horsepower <num> kw meadows engine
suspension was on eight road wheels four per side with no separate driver or <unk> wheels and it was capable of a <num> miles per hour <num> km h top speed
the mk vii design relied on an unusual steering method and a mechanical system incorporated into earlier vickers models
the front wheels could be steered to allow for gentle turns by bending the tracks
for sharper turns the system returned to the conventional method of braking one track to turn the tank the dual system of turning was designed to lessen mechanical strain on the <unk> and reduce its power <unk>
the suspension system was also a new design that relied on struts with pockets of air for <unk> and <unk> of oil for <unk> and each of the wheels was independently sprung
the war office examined the design and put the prototype through a series of trials during may and june <year> the model was tested as a possible light cruiser since war office light tank needs were already met by its predecessor the mark vi
the war office then took the view that the tank was not acceptable as a light cruiser because the nuffield <unk> offered better speed and obstacle crossing performance
despite this it was decided that it was essential for some <unk> to be produced and it was suggested that they be brought in at the end of the light tank program
accordingly the war office gave the <unk> the official general staff specification number <unk> and in november <year> accepted it for limited production after requesting a few minor changes which included the fitting of an external fuel tank to increase the tank 's range
production was to begin in july <year> but meanwhile the war office temporarily returned to its original order of <num> before increasing the number to <num>
the number further increased to <num> after metropolitan cammell carriage and wagon a company part owned by vickers @-@ armstrong that would be producing the tanks indicated it had already ordered armour plating for that many tanks
production of the tank was delayed by a number of factors
the war office put their order on hold in a post @-@ battle of france decision to focus military production on infantry and cruiser tanks due to the poor performance of british light tanks during that battle
due to the shortage of more suitable tanks light tanks that were not designed for use against german armour were nevertheless deployed against them the resulting high casualties led the war office to re @-@ evaluate the suitability of the light tank design
the pre @-@ war role of the light tank that of reconnaissance meanwhile had been found to be better suited to scout cars that used smaller crews and had better cross @-@ country abilities
further delays were caused by the bombing raids of the luftwaffe during may <year> against the factories where the tanks were assembled
the cumulative effect of these delays resulted in the production of only a small number of mk <unk> estimates place the final total produced to be between <num> and <num>
the name <unk> was given to the mk vii on <num> september <year> on the orders of the war office
the last of the tanks were built in the first quarter of <year> and delivered at the end of the year
this decision may have marked the end for the <unk> in active service several of the tanks destined to be deployed to the eighth army in the middle east for the north african campaign were left in britain when their cooling systems were determined to be unable to cope with the intense north african heat
the demise of <unk> was prevented by a decision made by the war office in mid @-@ <year> as it was considering the equipment to be used by britain 's fledgling airborne forces formed in june <year> under the orders of the prime minister winston churchill
when selecting the equipment for the airborne forces officials at the war office concluded that gliders would be an integral component gliders would transport troops and heavy equipment which by <year> was to include artillery and some form of tank
plans to transport a tank went through a number of revisions but by may <year> the feasibility of a <num>
<num> metric tons <num>
<num> long tons tank to be carried for <num> miles <num> km in a glider was accepted although the aircraft would have to be specifically designed for the task
in a conference held on <num> january <year> it was decided that the general aircraft <unk> currently under development would be used to transport a single <unk> tank or two universal carriers
the <unk> was chosen because it was an obsolete design and was therefore available to be used by the airborne forces
beginning in january <year> training exercises were conducted carrying the <unk> and their crews inside <unk> gliders
these exercises were successful during the training by c squadron of the glider pilot regiment which specialised in flying the <unk> over <num> @,@ <num> lifts were made with an average of <num> lifts per crew
only three incidents resulted in fatalities or injuries with seven pilots killed during the training
when the <unk> was re @-@ designated as an airborne tank several changes were made to its design
a number of tanks had their <num> pounder guns replaced with a <num>
<num> @-@ millimetre <num>
<num> in infantry support howitzer these tanks were then designated as <unk> <num> <unk> close support
additionally littlejohn <unk> were added to those <unk> which still possessed their <num> pounders to increase their muzzle velocity and armour penetration
the <unk> experienced several setbacks throughout its development and deployment with the army and airborne forces
one of the major problems was the limited number of these tanks that existed after production ended in <year> which particularly affected the airborne forces
the transport of <num> of the tanks to the ussr under the lend @-@ lease act depleted the number available for use by airborne forces as did the loss of several more during operation ironclad the invasion of madagascar
a royal armoured corps report issued in december <year> stated that approximately <num> <unk> were available for use
in a memorandum dated january <year> by major general george f
<unk> commander of the 1st airborne division <unk> complained that he had been informed that <num> of the tanks were available whereas only <num> actually remained with no reserves to replace those lost in combat
this lack of sufficient replacement reserves combined with a war office report that some <num> airborne tanks would be required for the 1st airborne division and an unnamed airborne division to be formed in india led to the <unk> 's eventual replacement by the us <num> <unk>
its size limited the possible crew to three a driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret resulting in too few crew members to operate the <unk> effectively
the gunner or commander in addition to his own duties had to act as loader for the <num> pounder which caused delays in combat
a report on the tank written in january <year> stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank controlling a troop of <unk> during combat would be almost impossible
problems were also found with the littlejohn adaptor fitted to the <num> @-@ pounder to increase its range and penetration power after they had been fitted the adapters could not be removed and could only fire specially designed armour @-@ piercing rounds which took time to manufacture
the war office also considered the <unk> 's cooling system faulty making the tank unsuitable for service in hotter climates such as the middle east and north africa
however the faults discovered with the <unk> cooling system precluded them from being integrated into units that were sent to the middle east to participate in the north african campaign
shortly after all light tanks were discarded from the establishments of british armoured divisions as not suitable for further service
the <unk> remained in britain and would probably have been used as training vehicles before being retired from service but on <num> june <year> the german invasion of the ussr operation barbarossa began and the ussr became an ally of britain
the lend @-@ lease program begun in march <year> by the united states of america to supply defensive materials to britain and china was therefore extended to the ussr
as part of the program the british government began supplying war materials to the ussr which in early <year> included a shipment of <num> <unk> as well as a number of valentine and matilda mk i infantry tanks
the soviet military utilised a greater number of light tanks than the british and so could use the <unk>
when the tanks arrived in the ussr however it was apparent that the design problems with the cooling system were also present in cold conditions additionally the cold weather had a <unk> effect on the tank 's suspension and tracks
additional testing of the <unk> was conducted by the soviet military and the design was admired for its <unk> manoeuvrability and speed as well its ability to run on low @-@ quality fuel unlike contemporary soviet designs
the thinness of the <unk> 's armour was found to be a problem and one which could not be solved as the weight of extra armour plating caused an unacceptable reduction in the tank 's speed
despite these drawbacks in the <unk> 's design soviet authorities believed it to be comparable to the t @-@ <num> light tank in use at the time and decided that it was suitable to be used in combat
a number of <unk> were sent to tank training schools which were subsequently sent into battle and in september <year> two were assigned to the <num> separated tank battalion which was attached to the <num> guards tank brigade both tanks were destroyed in combat one on <num> september and the other on <num> october the latter a casualty of artillery fire
several were also used for propaganda purposes appearing in photographs of soviet troops who were fighting in the caucasus region
both a and b squadrons were equipped with valentine infantry tanks and mark vic light tanks but c squadron was equipped with twelve <unk> transferred from the <num> armoured brigade 1st armoured division
on <num> july <year> c squadron was officially activated and immediately received orders to prepare for overseas service alongside a and b squadrons in an unspecified tropical climate
all three squadrons were transported to <unk> in scotland for intensive training that focused on embarkation and disembarkation from ships and landing craft to prepare them for action in potential amphibious operations
in early september elements of c squadron including six <unk> formed part of a force which sailed for freetown in west africa during this period of the war there were fears that the spanish government might enter the conflict on the side of germany and the force was readied to capture a number of spanish islands off the coast of africa if this occurred
these fears proved <unk> and in march <year> the unit returned to britain to join the rest of the squadron in training
the next assignment operation ironclad was the invasion of madagascar the third largest island in the world and then under <unk> french control
the prime minister and the combined chiefs of staff decided that madagascar should be occupied as rapidly as possible to deny the port of <unk> to japanese naval forces which had recently advanced into the indian ocean
operation ironclad was under the command of major general robert g
sturges and consisted of no
<num> commando <num> independent brigade group and the <num> and <num> brigade groups from <num> infantry division
the <num> brigade formed the core of the invasion force due to its training in amphibious operations and under its command was b special service squadron created by amalgamating six <unk> from b squadron and six <unk> from c squadron into a single unit
the squadron was formed into four troops one headquarters troop of three <unk> and one <unk> one of four <unk> and two formed from the remaining five <unk>
the invasion force assembled off the west coast of the northern tip of madagascar on <num> may near <unk> and the bay of diego <unk>
the invasion plan called for an amphibious assault landing on four beaches on the west side of the tip which would allow the british forces to advance approximately <num> miles <num> km and approach <unk> from the rear
information about the landing beaches the defences possessed by the port and the <unk> french defending forces was limited and vague although it was believed that the defenders had no weapons capable of penetrating the armour of a valentine tank
the landings began at <num> <num> on <num> may with <num> commando landing at <unk> bay and the three infantry brigades and b squadron landing at <unk> bay
the objective of the infantry brigades and their armoured support was to take control of <unk> and a nearby town but although the infantry landed successfully b squadron had more trouble the area of beach designated for its landing craft was blocked for several hours after a <unk> came loose from a landing craft and became stuck in the sand
the infantry brigades advanced toward <unk> without the squadron but eventually two <unk> and a single <unk> were dispatched in support catching up with the lead elements of the infantry near the town of <unk>
here the invasion force encountered the first french defences consisting of camouflaged trenches and pillboxes dug in along a ridge
the tanks attempted to breach them but the rocky ground made <unk> difficult and they could not close with the pillboxes and trenches they engaged a number of targets with <num> pounder and machine @-@ gun fire but the line had to be cleared by an infantry assault later in the day
the tanks were ordered to outflank the defences and advance further into the island and they were soon joined by two other <unk> dispatched from the beaches the small force continued to advance until it encountered the <unk> french main line of defence
this had been built prior to the first world war and included camouflaged pillboxes machine @-@ gun nests and dug @-@ in <num> mm artillery pieces the latter although not specifically designed for an anti @-@ tank role could penetrate the armour of both the <unk> and the <unk>
the two <unk> advanced first but were knocked out by artillery fire and two <unk> that were moving behind them suffered the same fate the third <unk> retreated in order to report on the french resistance machine <unk> a motorcycle combination and a truck it encountered on the way back
the commander of the <unk> made his report and was then ordered to take command of four <unk> and two <unk> which had recently arrived and once again attempt to breach the french defences
the tanks followed the road leading to the defensive line and then attempted to out @-@ flank the line by advancing from the right @-@ hand side using several hills as cover the artillery pieces were able to turn and face the assault however and one valentine and one <unk> were hit and destroyed
the remaining tanks exchanged several volleys of fire with the artillery pieces before retreating back to their original positions
the french line was eventually broken by <num> brigade aided by an amphibious assault by royal marines the remaining tanks of b squadron two <unk> and three <unk> remained in defensive positions until the afternoon of <num> may coming under sporadic artillery fire which disabled another valentine
the squadron played no further part in the battle as the <unk> french authorities negotiated a formal surrender the following day although french troops would continue to engage the british occupying force in guerrilla warfare until late november
c squadron suffered heavy casualties during the invasion only one valentine and three <unk> out of twelve tanks were functional by <num> may and the squadron had suffered seven killed and six wounded
it remained in madagascar until early <year> when it was shipped to india and took part in the burma campaign as part of <num> brigade
progress in setting up proper training facilities and acquiring suitable transport aircraft was so slow that the first british airborne operation operation colossus was conducted by a retrained commando unit
by <year> there existed specifically trained airborne units including the 1st airborne division and on <num> january <year> the war office decided that a light tank unit would be one of the support units attached to the division
this unit designated the light tank squadron was to be formed of nineteen light tanks and would operate to the fore of the division using their tanks speed to capture objectives and then holding them until relieved by other units
the obvious unit for conversion was c special services squadron as it was trained to act as an independent tank unit and more importantly was the only unit that was still using <unk> it had been re @-@ designated as an airborne tank by the war office
c squadron was officially transferred to the 1st airborne division on <num> june <year> bringing with it seven <unk> among its other vehicles
the unit immediately began training but was not attached to the 1st airborne division for long during mid @-@ <year> the division was transported to the middle east so it could participate in the allied invasion of sicily
c squadron remained in britain as not enough <unk> gliders had been built by the time the division departed to transport its <unk> the squadron was transferred to the <num> airborne division which had been raised in april <year> and c squadron remained with it for the rest of the conflict
the squadron continued to train as an air @-@ portable unit and participated in a number of exercises to prepare for its new duties including reconnaissance of enemy positions and counter @-@ attacking enemy infantry and armour
on <num> december <year> the war office decided to expand the squadron into a regiment equipped with a combination of light tanks and conventional reconnaissance vehicles such as scout cars and on <num> april <year> it was re @-@ designated as the <num> airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment
the regiment consisted of a headquarters squadron a light tank squadron and a reconnaissance squadron two <unk> the mark <num> <unk> variation were attached to the headquarters squadron but the light tank squadron also known as a squadron received the majority of the <unk>
a squadron had approximately nineteen <unk> split between six troops two of which were of the <unk> variation and the rest were armed with <num> pounders fitted with littlejohn <unk>
on <num> may <year> after participating in a further series of exercises and manoeuvres a squadron moved from their training area to a transit camp at tarrant <unk> airfield while the rest of the regiment moved to raf <unk> norton airfield the next day from these two airfields the regiment would be transported from to participate in the british airborne landings in normandy
the operation began on the night of <num> june with the deployment of <num> airborne division to eastern normandy
it was tasked with protecting the eastern flank of the allied <unk> landings securing strategically important areas east of caen capturing several important bridges over the caen canal and river dives and destroying a coastal artillery battery
insufficient transport aircraft were available to land all three of the division 's brigades simultaneously one would have to be landed in a second lift later in the day
major general richard gale had initially intended for the <num> <unk> brigade to which the <num> airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment was attached to be landed first however aerial photography revealed that anti @-@ glider poles had been erected in the landing zone selected for the brigade
therefore gale decided that the <num> parachute brigade and <num> parachute brigade which did not utilise gliders should land in the first lift to clear the landing zones allowing the <num> <unk> brigade to land in the second lift
the horsa and <unk> gliders of the brigade landed at <num> <num> on <num> june in a landing zone cleared of obstructions by the <num> parachute brigade
the primary tasks of the brigade were to bring in reinforcements and supplies and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division the <num> airborne armoured reconnaissance squadron was to aid in the latter task acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out german positions and impede the movement of german forces attempting to counter @-@ attack
the <unk> of a squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed but the squadron 's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in normandy
it lost one tank before the formation landed when the <unk> broke loose of its shackles and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it causing both to fall into the sea mid @-@ flight
the squadron 's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone destroying themselves and the <unk> they carried a third <unk> hit another <unk> as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down rendering it unusable although the crew escaped without injury
the surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their <unk> forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches
the squadron retrieved all of the remaining <unk> and advanced to the south of the landing zone to link up with the rest of the regiment there they received orders to support the <num> parachute battalion in the bois de <unk> area and conduct reconnaissance duties
after linking with the battalion the squadron began <unk> and engaged german infantry and armour they encountered
by the end of <num> june two <unk> had been lost to enemy action one destroyed by a german self @-@ propelled gun and the second by hitting a mine
the division was reinforced by british troops who were advancing from the invasion beaches and it began to push through normandy while the squadron continued its reconnaissance duties
at this time gale decided to avoid when possible engaging the <unk> with german armour as they proved to be completely outclassed by the german tanks and self @-@ propelled guns such as the panzer iv and the <unk> iii
instead when the division required armoured support it summoned it from armoured units outside the division and the <unk> were used to support infantry patrols and provide fire support
by august in the division 's preparation for the planned breakout from the normandy bridgehead the majority of <unk> in a squadron were replaced with cromwell fast cruiser tanks only three <unk> remained assigned to the headquarters troop of a squadron
during the first week of october <year> the <num> airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment underwent an extensive <unk> in which it was completely restructured and all the remaining <unk> were retired
they were replaced with the <num> <unk> a purpose @-@ built airborne light tank of american design eight locusts were used by the regiment in march <year> during operation varsity the airborne operation to cross the river rhine
a report issued by the director air of the war office in january <year> confirmed that the <unk> design was considered obsolete and any light tanks used in post @-@ war airborne formations would be entirely new in design
a small number of <unk> remained in service with the <num> hussars until <year> a <unk> glider flight was stationed at raf <unk> and a troop of <unk> was kept by the regiment for training exercises with the gliders
however glider training by the regiment was stopped in <year> and the <unk> withdrawn from service
the first was the light tank mk viii vickers @-@ armstrong 's proposed successor to the <unk>
the mark viii was also known as the harry hopkins named after president roosevelt 's chief diplomatic advisor and was given the general staff design number <unk> by the war office
the mark viii was intended to improve upon the design of the <unk> in a number of areas
it had thicker armour than the <unk> with the front hull and turret armour increased to a thickness of <num> millimetres <num>
<num> in and the side armour to <num> millimetres <num>
<num> in and the turret and hull given more sloped surfaces to help <unk> shells fired at the tank
the dimensions of the <unk> were also changed the mark viii was longer by <num> inches <num>
<num> m wider by <num> foot <num> inches <num>
<num> m and heavier
the new tank was no longer air @-@ portable as it was too heavy to be carried by a <unk>
the <num> @-@ cylinder engine of the <unk> was fitted to the mark viii although the increased weight meant that its maximum speed decreased to <num> miles per hour <num> km h its armament also remained the same as that of the <unk>
the war office authorised the construction of three prototype models in april <year>
the new design was considered a success and the tank board of the war office ordered <num> @,@ <num> to be constructed in september
however problems were encountered with further tests of the prototypes and a report issued in december <year> stated that production of the mark viii had been delayed due to developmental problems
these problems continued to persist into <year> when the war office decided against using the tank in active service approximately <num> mark <unk> were produced by <year> when production ended
a second variant on the <unk> design was the <unk> <unk> drive <unk> dd
the <unk> drive system was invented by nicholas <unk> and was designed to allow a tank to swim through water and participate in amphibious operations
the system functioned by erecting a large waterproof canvas screen around the tank above its tracks which was supported by thirty @-@ six inflatable tubes and steel struts this gave the tank sufficient <unk> to float and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank 's engine
the screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once the tank reached land
the system was fitted during june <year> as the <unk> was the lightest light tank available at the time the converted tank was successfully tested on a number of lakes and reservoirs allowing the <unk> drive system to be tested on heavier tanks such as the valentine
the system would be used during operation overlord when <num> sherman medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches
the game was released in europe in <year> in north america on december <num> <year> and in japan on december <num> <year>
<unk> stars donald duck and his three nephews huey dewey and louie as treasure @-@ hunters and is part of a series of games published by sega that were based on walt disney cartoon characters
<unk> was released to mostly positive reviews from video game journalists
the game was universally lauded for its graphics with magazines like sega pro describing them as some of the best graphics around
the game was also praised for its music and puzzles as well as their clever use in the game
however <unk> was criticized for its controls being described by ign as float @-@ y and making certain segments of the game unnecessarily difficult
the game was also criticized for its lack of difficulty overall as well as its lack of speech samples which several other genesis games of the time had
generally each level is divided into an overland part and a dungeon such as the <unk> 's palace or the temple in which the great duck treasure resides
although the player may choose any order to play the overland sections various obstacles prevent the player from entering the dungeons outside of a specific order
in addition to this some levels provide the player with vital clues which solve puzzles needed to progress in later sections
once donald has completed the overland section of an area he may leave by calling his nephews biplane and will return to the dungeon entrance of that area if the player chooses to return
donald is armed with a special gun that can shoot <unk> popcorn or bubble gum
donald has unlimited <unk> which can only temporarily <unk> enemies though bosses can still be damaged with <unk> and can collect popcorn and gum along the way or get the latter from <unk> <unk>
later in the game the plunger is upgraded to act as a temporary platform to climb walls with and when stuck to a passing bird allows donald to traverse longer distances
in <unk> india and egypt donald can also pick up chili peppers which increase his temper eventually temporarily allowing him to become invincible increase his speed and knock out enemies in his path
the map leads to the location of the king 's most prized possession hidden in a secret place shortly before his death
donald thinks this is his path to riches
unfortunately big bad pete overhears and pursues donald throughout the game hoping to steal the treasure
teamed with his nephews huey dewey and louie and using the partial map from the library donald begins his search in <unk> with the trail being directed to an aztec pyramid in mexico
outside the pyramid he is directed by a sweet <unk> to obtain a hero key from an explorer back in <unk> to open the pyramid
inside the pyramid donald meets goofy who gives him a strange note and a plunger to help him reach higher places and tells him that <unk> <unk> is looking for him back in <unk>
travelling across the <unk> of <unk> to meet <unk> donald is given <unk> 's latest invention bubblegum <unk> that can break through walls
the last location on the partial map is count dracula 's castle in transylvania where donald encounters a ghost who tells him that the count carries the real treasure map
after defeating dracula donald receives a more complete map
in india donald enters the palace of the <unk> where she challenges him to defeat the tiger in her garden in exchange for a sphinx tear
donald succeeds and receives the sphinx tear which is the key to open a temple in egypt
donald is able to solve the riddle of the sphinx using the note goofy had given him and obtains the <unk> of ra before escaping in a mine cart
from there he journeys to the south pole where he finds a key frozen in ice and uses the <unk> of ra to melt the ice and grab the key
the key unlocks the hold of a viking ship which contains an ancient diary with the secret to locating the treasure
the ship is haunted by ghosts and the viking captain sends donald below decks to get rid of them
after defeating a skeletal viking warrior donald returns to the deck where the captain informs him that the diary is hidden in ice near the south pole and gives him an ancient viking plunger that attaches to flying creatures
donald then returns to the south pole <unk> a ride on one of pete 's bird minions to reach the diary
however upon finding the diary pete shows up holding donald 's nephews hostage in exchange for the diary
after giving pete the diary donald travels to pete 's hideout to defeat pete and get the diary back
the diary reveals that the map when dipped in water will reveal the location of the great duck treasure
donald flies to the island where the treasure is hidden and manages to evade its traps in order to reach the treasure vault
after defeating the ancient spirit guarding the treasure donald opens the vault only to find a simple stone statue
when the disappointed donald returns home huey dewey and louie accidentally break the statue which reveals a golden <unk> necklace was hidden inside
donald gives the necklace to daisy and the two fly off into the sunset together
the game was released in europe in <year> in north america on december <num> <year> and in japan on december <num> <year>
<unk> was later released as part of a bundle called the disney collection for genesis in <year> alongside castle of illusion
the game was also ported to the sega saturn and released exclusively in japan alongside castle of illusion again as part of the sega ages series in <year> entitled sega ages i love mickey mouse
gamerankings an aggregator for video game reviews assigned the game a score of <num> based on <num> reviews
mega placed the game at <num> in their top mega drive games of all time list
<unk> magazine praised the game 's graphics but criticized the game 's easy difficulty level explaining simply that the graphics are excellent but the game is easy to complete
damian butt from sega pro also praised the graphics stating that the game has without a doubt some of the best graphics around and that the sprites and backgrounds are consistently excellent
he also noted the game 's various puzzles and their use in the game explaining that e ven if the ideas are not original the way they are strung together to accelerate the pace to overload is nothing short of breath @-@ taking
levi buchanan from ign gave <unk> a <num>
<num> <num> also lauding the graphics and animation as excellent and saying the music was pleasing
butt criticized donald 's controls in certain situations in the game as well as the difficulty of some levels and puzzles
buchanan also criticized the controls calling them float @-@ y and noted the difficulty in executing precision jumps explaining that i t 's far too easy to <unk> or under @-@ shoot a narrow column and slip to your doom
butt was also dubious of the number of credits stating that the game may seem easy with unlimited continues but that the player will still need considerable skill to reach the treasure island
buchanan was disappointed with the lack of speech samples explaining that it 's a bit of a drag with a character that is so defined by his voice
ultimately butt said that y <unk> players will instantly be <unk> by donald 's quest and that <unk> is everything a cartoon game should be and more
buchanan summed up the game as being a good platformer tripped up by some questionable controls and recommended the game as a mildly enjoyable <num> @-@ bit platformer that would fit nicely in your genesis collection
the heads date from at least before <num> bc and are a distinctive feature of the olmec civilization of ancient mesoamerica
all portray mature men with fleshy cheeks flat <unk> and slightly crossed eyes their physical characteristics correspond to a type that is still common among the inhabitants of tabasco and veracruz
the backs of the monuments often are flat
the boulders were brought from the sierra de los <unk> mountains of veracruz
given that the extremely large slabs of stone used in their production were transported over large distances requiring a great deal of human effort and resources it is thought that the monuments represent portraits of powerful individual olmec rulers
each of the known examples has a distinctive headdress
the heads were variously arranged in lines or groups at major olmec centres but the method and logistics used to transport the stone to these sites remain unclear
the discovery of a colossal head at tres <unk> in the nineteenth century spurred the first archaeological investigations of olmec culture by matthew stirling in <year>
seventeen confirmed examples are known from four sites within the olmec heartland on the gulf coast of mexico
most colossal heads were sculpted from spherical boulders but two from san lorenzo <unk> were re @-@ carved from massive stone thrones
an additional monument at <unk> <unk> in guatemala is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head
this is the only known example from outside the olmec heartland
dating the monuments remains difficult because of the movement of many from their original contexts prior to archaeological investigation
most have been dated to the early <unk> period <year> – <num> bc with some to the middle <unk> <num> – <num> bc period
the smallest weigh <num> tons while the largest is variously estimated to weigh <num> to <num> tons although it was abandoned and left unfinished close to the source of its stone
the olmec heartland lies on the gulf coast of mexico within the states of veracruz and tabasco an area measuring approximately <num> kilometres <num> mi east to west and extending about <num> kilometres <num> mi inland from the coast
the <unk> are regarded as the first civilization to develop in mesoamerica and the olmec heartland is one of six <unk> of civilization worldwide the others being the norte chico culture of south america the <unk> culture of china 's yellow river the indus valley civilization of south asia the civilization of ancient egypt and the sumerian civilization of ancient iraq
of these only the olmec civilization developed in a lowland tropical forest setting
the <unk> were the first inhabitants of the americas to construct monumental architecture and to settle in towns and cities
they were also the first people in the americas to develop a sophisticated style of stone sculpture
in the first decade of the 21st century evidence emerged of olmec writing with the earliest examples of olmec hieroglyphs dating to around <num> bc
examples of script have been found on roller stamps and stone artefacts the texts are short and have been partially deciphered based on their similarity to other mesoamerican scripts
the evidence of complex society developing in the olmec heartland has led to the <unk> being regarded as the mother culture of mesoamerica although this concept remains controversial
some of the <unk> rulers seem to have served religious functions
the city of san lorenzo was succeeded as the main centre of the civilization by la <unk> in about <num> bc with tres <unk> and laguna de los <unk> possibly sharing the role other urban centres were much less significant
the nature and degree of the control exercised by the centres over a widespread rural population remains unclear
very fine olmec art much clearly made for an elite survives in several forms notably olmec figurines and larger sculptures such as the wrestler
the figurines have been recovered in large numbers and are mostly in pottery these were presumably widely available to the population
together with these of particular relevance to the colossal heads are the olmec @-@ style masks in stone so called because none have yet been excavated in circumstances that allow the proper archaeological identification of an olmec context
these evocative stone face masks present both similarities and differences to the colossal heads
two thirds of olmec monumental sculpture represents the human form and the colossal heads fall within this major theme of olmec art
however the san lorenzo heads were buried by <num> bc indicating that their period of manufacture and use was earlier still
the heads from tres <unk> had been moved from their original context before they were investigated by archaeologists and the heads from la <unk> were found partially exposed on the modern ground surface
the period of production of the colossal heads is therefore unknown as is whether it spanned a century or a millennium
estimates of the time span during which colossal heads were produced vary from <num> to <num> years
the san lorenzo heads are believed to be the oldest and are the most <unk> executed
all of the stone heads have been assigned to the <unk> period of mesoamerican chronology generally to the early <unk> <year> – <num> bc although the two tres <unk> heads and the la <unk> head are attributed to the middle <unk> <num> – <num> bc
<num> to <num>
<num> metres <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> ft and weigh between <num> and <num> tons
all of the olmec colossal heads depict mature men with flat <unk> and fleshy cheeks the eyes tend to be slightly crossed
the general physical characteristics of the heads are of a type that is still common among people in the olmec region in modern times
the backs of the heads are often flat as if the monuments were originally placed against a wall
all examples of olmec colossal heads wear distinctive headdresses that probably represent cloth or animal hide originals
some examples have a tied knot at the back of the head and some are decorated with feathers
a head from la <unk> is decorated with the head of a bird
there are similarities between the headdresses on some of the heads that has led to speculation that specific headdresses may represent different dynasties or perhaps identify specific rulers
most of the heads wear large <unk> inserted into the ear lobes
all of the heads are realistic <unk> and frank descriptions of the men
it is likely that they were portraits of living or recently deceased rulers well known to the sculptors
each head is distinct and <unk> displaying <unk> features
they were once thought to represent <unk> although this theory is no longer widely held it is possible however that they represent rulers equipped for the mesoamerican ballgame
facial expressions depicted on the heads vary from stern through placid to smiling
the most <unk> olmec art is the earliest appearing suddenly without surviving antecedents with a tendency towards more stylised sculpture as time progressed
some surviving examples of wooden sculpture recovered from el <unk> demonstrate that the <unk> are likely to have created many more <unk> sculptures than works sculpted from stone
in the late nineteenth century josé <unk> y serrano described a colossal head as having ethiopian features and speculations that the olmec had african origins resurfaced in <year> in the work of alfonso <unk> <unk> and in the <num> in the writings of ivan van <unk>
such speculation is not taken seriously by mesoamerican scholars such as richard <unk> and ann <unk>
although all the colossal heads are broadly similar there are distinct stylistic differences in their execution
one of the heads from san lorenzo bears traces of plaster and red paint suggesting that the heads were originally brightly decorated
heads did not just represent individual olmec rulers they also incorporated the very concept of rulership itself
the workforce would have included sculptors labourers <unk> boatmen <unk> and other <unk> producing the tools to make and move the monument in addition to the support needed to feed and otherwise attend to these workers
the seasonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the production of the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end
archaeological investigation of olmec basalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away both large and small flakes of stone
the sculpture was then refined by <unk> the surface using <unk> which were generally rounded <unk> that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself although this was not always the case
<unk> were found in association with workshops at san lorenzo indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail
olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in @-@ the @-@ round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the <unk> and headdresses
monument <num> at san lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche
its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned
it is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re @-@ carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed
all seventeen of the confirmed heads in the olmec heartland were sculpted from basalt mined in the sierra de los <unk> mountains of veracruz
most were formed from coarse grained dark grey basalt known as <unk> <unk> basalt after a volcano in the range
investigators have proposed that large <unk> <unk> basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains are the source of the stone for the monuments
these boulders are found in an area affected by large <unk> volcanic mudslides that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes which suggests that the <unk> did not need to quarry the raw material for <unk> the heads
roughly spherical boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head
the stone for the san lorenzo and la <unk> heads was transported a considerable distance from the source
the la <unk> head was found on el <unk> hill in the sierra de los <unk> and the stone from tres <unk> colossal head <num> and <unk> colossal head <num> also known as tres <unk> monuments a and q came from the same hill
the boulders were transported over <num> kilometres <num> mi from the source of the stone
the exact method of transportation of such large masses of rock are unknown especially since the <unk> lacked beasts of burden and functional wheels and they were likely to have used water transport whenever possible
coastal currents of the gulf of mexico and in river estuaries might have made the waterborne transport of monuments weighing <num> tons or more impractical
two badly damaged olmec sculptures depict rectangular stone blocks bound with ropes
a largely destroyed human figure rides upon each block with their legs hanging over the side
these sculptures may well depict olmec rulers overseeing the transport of the stone that would be fashioned into their monuments
when transport over land was necessary the <unk> are likely to have used <unk> ramps and roads to facilitate moving the heads
the regional terrain offers significant obstacles such as swamps and floodplains avoiding these would have necessitated crossing undulating hill country
the construction of temporary <unk> using the suitable and plentiful floodplain soils would have allowed a direct route across the floodplains to the san lorenzo plateau
earth structures such as mounds platforms and <unk> upon the plateau demonstrate that the olmec possessed the necessary knowledge and could commit the resources to build large @-@ scale earthworks
the flat backs of many of the colossal heads represented the flat bases of the monumental thrones from which they were reworked
only four of the seventeen heartland heads do not have flattened backs indicating the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments
alternatively the backs of many of these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport providing a stable form for hauling the monuments with ropes
two heads from san lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental olmec thrones and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments
an additional monument at <unk> <unk> in guatemala is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head
this is the only known example outside of the olmec heartland on the gulf coast of mexico
possible fragments of additional colossal heads have been recovered at san lorenzo and at san fernando in tabasco
crude colossal stone heads are also known in the southern maya area where they are associated with the <unk> style of sculpture
although some arguments have been made that they are pre @-@ olmec these latter monuments are generally believed to be influenced by the olmec style of sculpture
although some were recovered from <unk> they were found close to their original placements and had been buried by local erosion
these heads together with a number of monumental stone thrones probably formed a processional route across the site powerfully displaying its dynastic history
two of the san lorenzo heads had been re @-@ carved from older thrones
san lorenzo colossal head <num> also known as san lorenzo monument <num> was lying facing upwards when excavated
the erosion of a path passing on top of the monument uncovered its eye and led to the discovery of the olmec site

it was associated with a large number of broken ceramic vessels and figurines
the majority of these ceramic remains have been dated to between <num> and <num> bc some pieces have been dated to the villa alta phase late classic period <num> – <num> ad
the headdress possesses a plain band that is tied at the back of the head
the upper portion of the headdress is decorated with a u @-@ shaped motif
this element descends across the front of the headdress terminating on the forehead
on the front portion it is decorated with five semicircular motifs
the <unk> piece does not meet the horizontal band leaving a space between the two pieces
on each side of the face a strap descends from the headdress and passes in front of the ear
the forehead is wrinkled in a frown
the lips are slightly parted without revealing the teeth
the cheeks are pronounced and the ears are particularly well executed
the face is slightly asymmetric which may be due to error on the part of the sculptors or may accurately reflect the physical features of the portrait 's subject
the head has been moved to the museo de <unk> de xalapa anthropological museum of xalapa

the mixed ceramics have been dated to the san lorenzo and villa alta phases approximately <year> – <num> bc and <num> – <num> ad respectively
colossal head <num> is particularly well preserved although the back of the headdress band was damaged when the head was moved from the archaeological site
the band of the headdress is set at an angle and has a notch above the bridge of the nose
the headdress is decorated with jaguar paws this general identification of the decoration is contested by <unk> de la <unk> since the paws have three claws each she identifies them as the claws of a bird of prey

the two tres <unk> heads are the earliest known stone monuments from the site
the discovery of one of the tres <unk> heads in the nineteenth century led to the first archaeological investigations of olmec culture carried out by matthew stirling in <year>
tres <unk> monument a also known as tres <unk> colossal head <num> was the first colossal head to be found discovered by accident in the middle of the nineteenth century <num> kilometre <num>
<num> mi to the north of the modern village of tres <unk>
after its discovery it remained half @-@ buried until it was excavated by matthew stirling in <year>
at some point it was moved to the plaza of the modern village probably in the early <num>

<num> metres <num>

the head is sculpted with a simple headdress with a wide band that is otherwise unadorned and wears rectangular ear ornaments that project forwards onto the cheeks
the face is carved with deep <unk> between the cheeks and the nose and around the mouth the forehead is <unk> into a frown
the upper lip has suffered recent damage with the left portion <unk> away

<num> metres <num>

<num> metres <num>
<num> ft deep and weighs <num>

its exact date of discovery is unknown but is estimated to have been some time in the <num> when it was struck by machinery being used to clear vegetation from <unk> hill
monument q was the eleventh colossal head to be discovered
it was moved to the plaza of santiago tuxtla in <year> and remains there to this day
monument q was first described by williams and <unk> in an article published in <year>
the headdress is decorated with a frontal tongue @-@ shaped ornament and the back of the head is sculpted with seven <unk> of hair bound with <unk>
a strap descends from each side of the headdress passing over the ears and to the base of the monument
the face has pronounced <unk> around the nose mouth and eyes
the la <unk> colossal head was discovered in <year> and was the fifteenth to be recorded
it was discovered in a mountain pass in the sierra de los <unk> on the north side of el <unk> volcano near to santiago tuxtla
the head was largely buried when found excavations uncovered a late classic <num> – <num> ad offering associated with the head consisting of a ceramic vessel and a <num> @-@ <unk> <num>
<num> in long obsidian knife placed pointing northwards towards the head
the offering is believed to have been deposited long after the head was sculpted

<num> by <num>
<num> ft by <num>
<num> metres <num> ft high making it the largest known head
this massive sculpture is estimated to weigh <num> tons
it is stylistically distinct from the other examples and <unk> de la <unk> placed it late in the olmec time frame
the characteristics of the sculpture have led to some investigators suggesting that it represents a deceased person
norman hammond argues that the apparent stylistic differences of the monument stem from its unfinished state rather than its late production
the eyes of the monument are closed the nose is flattened and lacks nostrils and the mouth was not sculpted in a realistic manner
the headdress is in the form of a plain horizontal band
the original location of the la <unk> head was not a major archaeological site and it is likely that the head was either abandoned at its source or during transport to its intended destination
various features of the head suggest that it was unfinished such as a lack of symmetry below the mouth and an area of rough stone above the base
rock was not removed from around the <unk> as on other heads and does not narrow towards the base
large parts of the monument seem to be roughed out without finished detail
the right hand <unk> also appears incomplete the forward portion is marked with a sculpted line while the rear portion has been sculpted in relief probably indicating that the right cheek and eye area were also unfinished
the la <unk> head was almost certainly carved from a raw boulder rather than being sculpted from a throne
it appears to be an olmec @-@ style colossal head re @-@ carved into a niche figure sculpture
if originally a colossal head then it would be the only known example from outside the olmec heartland

lee parsons contests john graham 's identification of monument <num> as a re @-@ carved colossal head he views the side ornaments identified by graham as ears as rather the <unk> eyes of an open @-@ <unk> monster <unk> upwards
countering this james porter has claimed that the re @-@ carving of the face of a colossal head into a niche figure is clearly evident
monument <num> was damaged in the mid @-@ twentieth century by a local mason who attempted to break its exposed upper portion using a steel <unk>
as a result the top is fragmented although the broken pieces were recovered by archaeologists and have been put back into place

stevens received fan letters from around the world and his phone rang off the hook
he was invited to throw the ceremonial first pitch before the chicago cubs vs
florida marlins game in chicago on may <num>
it 's all been very surreal stevens said
if you are the runner @-@ up you don 't expect to talk to the president
it 's been a little overwhelming because i 'm a pretty simple guy he added
the <year> – <num> season also helped increase butler 's recruiting profile
asked if the increased fame would change things stevens said it better not spoil him or the university
i look at this new challenge of not changing and sticking to your core values and making sure you remain humble as a great coaching opportunity
duke coach mike <unk> agreed saying butler would be right up there no
<num> or no
<num>
they 'll be a favorite next year
however <unk> chose to leave early for the nba draft and butler went through a rough patch early in the season at one point losing three straight games and having a <num> – <num> conference record
bolstered by the emergence of andrew smith at center and matt howard 's success as a perimeter forward butler ended up winning a share of the conference title at <num> – <num>

for the second consecutive year the bulldogs fell in the national championship game this time to connecticut
financial terms of the contract were not disclosed however butler president bobby <unk> had publicly stated that the university could afford to increase stevens base salary to approximately us <num> @,@ <num> @,@ <num> a few days prior
stevens had previously made us <num> @,@ <num> plus benefits in base salary a relatively low figure for a successful division i head basketball coach
his total compensation for <year> – <num> was estimated at us <num> @,@ <num>
stevens had received a raise after each of his three seasons at butler and his contract contains a buyout clause estimated in the high six or low seven figures
by re @-@ signing with butler stevens temporarily ended speculation that he would leave the university for a higher paying job
oregon clemson and wake forest were all said to be interested in offering stevens multi @-@ million dollar contracts to leave butler
first and foremost i ’ m loyal to butler stevens said
when asked if he would ever leave butler stevens replied i guess if they kicked me out
after the <year> – <num> season stevens was pursued vigorously by illinois to fill their coaching vacancy before he declined their offer
in march <year> ucla reportedly offered stevens between <num>
<num> and <num> million a year to leave butler
rumors circulated that stevens was in contract negotiations with ucla but ultimately the rumors proved false and stevens stayed at butler
commenting on the situation a source close to stevens said brad doesn 't understand why people would assume he 's leaving
a few days later stevens reiterated that he was very happy at butler and had no intentions to leave as long as he had the support of the university to continue running the program the right way
reports state that his new contract is a six @-@ year <num> million deal
in april <year> stevens led the celtics to the nba playoffs as the <num> seed in the eastern conference with a <num> – <num> record
on april <num> <year> it was announced that stevens finished fourth in voting for the nba 's coach of the year award
on march <num> <year> stevens was named the eastern conference coach of the month for games played during february
in april <year> brad stevens led the celtics to their second consecutive playoff appearance under his tenure as the <num> seed in the <year> nba playoffs finishing the season with a <num> – <num> record
on june <num> <year> stevens received a contract extension
he decided that a team 's play will reflect the mood of its coach a calm coach means a team that will remain poised in difficult game situations while a nervous coach means a team that plays on edge
i don ’ t want to lose a game because of my approach he told himself
accordingly he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games
he rarely raises his voice or gets emotional instead quietly observing on the sideline with folded arms
he does not get upset about bad calls by referees or player mistakes preferring to focus on the next play rather than what just happened
butler player willie <unk> explained butler 's <year> final four run by saying when those big runs by syracuse and kansas state came coach called a timeout and said a few calm words
then he said he believes in us he loves us and we 're going to win the game
on the rare occasion stevens feels the need to correct a player he does it with positive reinforcement just at a little louder <unk> according to former assistant coach matthew graves
above all stevens wants his players to be confident not living in fear of being <unk> for making a bad play
externally stevens is always calm but internally he is far from it
i 'm not as calm as everybody thinks stevens says
his wife tracy adds he ’ s calm and collected but he ’ s fiercely competitive
he ’ s always thinking about how he can beat you
former player joel <unk> says everyone sees brad as a level @-@ headed calm and cool coach but he ’ s about as competitive of a guy as i know
we would get into it constantly whether playing two @-@ on @-@ two or arguing about players ’ having better college careers
stevens spends a lot of time preparing for each game and always tries to add a few new wrinkles specific to that game 's opponent
sports illustrated calls stevens an expert on breaking down tape and looking at statistical trends to find opponents weaknesses
former player ronald <unk> agrees we know everything we need to about our opponents all their tendencies are broken down ahead of time
stevens is a proponent of using statistical analysis to enhance his coaching decisions spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film
i think it 's a unique way of looking at the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players he explains
for example when butler was <unk> in late <year> stevens challenged his team this <num> defensive field goal percentage is where we are
this isn 't acceptable to get to where we want to go
but what does that really mean it 's not just get better <unk> it is if we give up <num> less baskets a game then we will be at <num> percent field goal percentage defense which will be top <num> in the country
the team got the message improved throughout the season and ultimately went on a march run fueled by defense
in <year> stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added drew cannon to the staff
if he had the resources stevens says he would hire a team of <unk> to analyze the teams play
stevens teams are built around solid basketball fundamentals and good team work rather than individual basketball skill
his teams are known for their defense forcing opponents into uncharacteristic mistakes
the secret to basketball – and life – is just to do the job to the best of your ability and don 't worry about anything else stevens says
win the next game
win the next possession
that 's our focus
it 's boring
it 's also the way championships are won he says
in short stevens is a strong believer in the butler way – doing all the little things that transform a group of good basketball players into a great basketball team
i tell the players the butler way isn 't easy to define stevens says but you can see it on the floor when we share the basketball play with great energy and defend
stevens prefers to recruit strong team players instead of going after top recruits
the guys we have recruited most of them weren 't very highly ranked stevens says
they had very good high school careers or careers at other places transfers but for one reason or the other they weren 't seen as great players
but they all had intangibles
stevens puts a strong emphasis on education and has said he would only recruit a one and done player if he was committed to getting his degree while playing professionally
stevens has often been referred to as a coaching prodigy but is not interested in self @-@ promotion
he instead prefers to <unk> the praise he receives to the players athletic department and his <unk>
he has not been known to posture for more money or to leak his name for open coaching positions
he has been described as humble modest and not about the money
the new york times usa today espn and other commentators have attributed butler 's success against teams with superior athletes to stevens coaching style
the times remarks the bulldogs are very well prepared for their opponents and they do not rattle easily and says that the resulting confidence has led to the team 's success
he coaches to his personality and to his strengths <unk> says
obviously he has great <unk> and communication ability with his team
yahoo sports compared stevens to legendary coach john wooden writing brad stevens is winning at butler the wooden way – calm and composed on the sideline
wooden agreed saying i enjoy watching stevens and very much enjoy butler 's style of play
one commentator remarked stevens looks like he checks the mirror every morning to see if it 's time to start shaving
on occasion he has been mistaken for a player
he is also known for projecting a professional corporate look from the sidelines
asked what his life would be like if he had never taken up coaching he replies if everything else remained the same i would have been as happy as heck
friends and family and faith they 're going to take the cake over all this stuff
stevens met his wife tracy née <unk> while attending <unk> university
tracy who played soccer for <unk> quickly learned of brad 's love for basketball on their third date he drove her an hour and a half to attend a high school basketball game
tracy graduated from rocky river high school in <year> and from <unk> in <year>
she returned to school in <year> driving five hours from case western 's law school to indianapolis on weekends to see brad
she finished her final year of law school in indianapolis and the couple married in august <year>
tracy works as a labor and employment lawyer
tracy also serves as brad 's agent
brad and tracy stevens are involved with the american cancer society 's coaches vs
cancer
brad says that the cause really hit home for them after tracy 's mother died of the disease in june <year>
the day before butler 's <year> final four appearance they hosted a fundraiser for the organization
brad stevens has also volunteered his time to the <unk> foundation for kids a charity benefiting <unk> children run by former butler player avery <unk>
stevens remains in close touch with the butler basketball family he notably took a one @-@ game leave from the celtics in january <year> to visit with andrew smith a player on both of butler 's final four teams who was dying of cancer smith died less than a week later
at the request of andrew 's widow sam brad delivered the eulogy at the memorial service on january <num> <year>

the peaks along the crater 's rim are exposed to almost continual sunlight while the interior is perpetually in shadow a crater of eternal darkness
the low @-@ temperature interior of this crater functions as a cold trap that may capture and freeze <unk> shed during comet impacts on the moon
measurements by the lunar prospector spacecraft showed higher than normal amounts of hydrogen within the crater which may indicate the presence of water ice
the crater is named after antarctic explorer ernest shackleton
the crater is <num> km in diameter and <num>
<num> km deep
from the earth it is viewed edge @-@ on in a region of rough cratered terrain
it is located within the south pole @-@ <unk> basin on a massif
the rim is slightly raised about the surrounding surface and it has an outer rampart that has been only lightly impacted
no significant craters intersect the rim and it is sloped about <num>
<num> ° toward the direction <num> – <num> ° from the earth
the age of the crater is about <num>
<num> billion years and it has been in the proximity of the south lunar pole for at least the last two billion years
because the orbit of the moon is tilted only <num> ° from the ecliptic the interior of this crater lies in perpetual darkness
estimates of the area in permanent shadow were obtained from earth @-@ based radar studies
peaks along the rim of the crater are almost continually illuminated by sunlight spending about <num> – <num> of each lunar orbit exposed to the sun
continuously illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have been predicted to exist since the <num>
the shadowed portion of the crater was <unk> with the terrain camera of the japanese <unk> spacecraft using the illumination of sunlight reflected off the rim
the interior of the crater consists of a symmetrical <num> ° slope that leads down to a <num>
<num> km diameter floor
the handful of craters along the interior span no more than a few hundred meters
the bottom is covered by an uneven mound @-@ like feature that is <num> to <num> m thick
the central peak is about <num> m in height
the continuous shadows in the south polar craters cause the floors of these formations to maintain a temperature that never exceeds about <num> k
for shackleton the average temperature was determined to be about <num> k reaching <num> k at the crater floor
under these conditions the estimated rate of loss from any ice in the interior would be <num> − <num> to <num> − <num> m s
any water vapor that arrives here following a cometary impact on the moon would lie permanently frozen on or below the surface
however the surface albedo of the crater floor matches the lunar far @-@ side suggesting that there is no exposed surface ice
this crater was named after ernest henry shackleton an anglo @-@ irish explorer of antarctica from <year> until his death in <year>
the name was officially adopted by the international astronomical union in <year>
nearby craters of note include shoemaker haworth de <unk> <unk> and <unk>
somewhat farther away on the eastern hemisphere of the lunar near side are the larger craters amundsen and scott named after two other early explorers of the antarctic continent
detailed mapping of the polar regions and <unk> of the moon did not occur until the advent of orbiting spacecraft
shackleton lies entirely within the rim of the immense south pole @-@ <unk> basin which is one of the largest known impact formations in the solar system
this basin is over <num> kilometers deep and an exploration of its properties could provide useful information about the lunar interior
a neutron spectrometer on board the lunar prospector spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to the northern and southern lunar poles including the crater shackleton
at the end of this mission in july <year> the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater shoemaker in the hope of detecting from earth @-@ based telescopes an impact @-@ generated plume containing water vapor
the impact event did not produce any detectable water vapor and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals or that the impact site did not contain any ice
alternatively it is possible that the crash did not excavate deeply enough into the <unk> to liberate significant quantities of water vapor
from earth @-@ based radar and spacecraft images of the crater edge shackleton appears to be relatively intact much like a young crater that has not been significantly eroded from subsequent impacts
this may mean that the inner sides are relatively steep which may make traversing the sides relatively difficult for a robotic vehicle
in addition it is possible that the interior floor might not have collected a significant quantity of <unk> since its formation
however other craters in the vicinity are considerably older and may contain significant deposits of hydrogen possibly in the form of water ice
see shoemaker lunar crater for example
radar studies preceding and following the lunar prospector mission demonstrate that the inner walls of shackleton are similar in reflective characteristics to those of some <unk> craters
in particular the surroundings appear to contain a significant number of blocks in its ejecta blanket suggesting that its radar properties are a result of surface roughness and not ice deposits as was previously suggested from a radar experiment involving the <unk> mission
this interpretation however is not universally agreed upon within the scientific community
radar images of the crater at a wavelength of <num> cm show no evidence for water ice deposits
optical imaging inside the crater was done for the first time by the japanese lunar orbiter spacecraft <unk> in <year>
it did not have any evidence of significant amount of water ice down to the image resolution of <num> m per pixel
on november <num> <year> a <num> @-@ kg probe made a hard landing near the crater
the moon impact probe <unk> was launched from the indian <unk> @-@ i spacecraft and reached the surface <num> minutes later
the probe carried a radar <unk> video imaging system and a mass spectrometer which will be used to search for water
at these locales sunlight is almost always available for conversion into electricity using solar panels potentially making them good locations for future moon landings
the temperature at this site is also more favorable than at more equatorial latitudes as it does not experience the daily temperature extremes of <num> ° c when the sun is overhead to as low as − <num> ° c during the lunar night
while scientific experiments performed by <unk> and lunar prospector could indicate the presence of water in the polar craters the current evidence is far from definitive
there are doubts among scientists as to whether or not the hydrogen is in the form of ice as well as to the concentration of this ore with depth below the surface
resolution of this issue will require future missions to the moon
the presence of water suggests that the crater floor could potentially be mined for deposits of hydrogen in water form a commodity that is expensive to deliver directly from the earth
this crater has also been proposed as a future site for a large infrared telescope
the low temperature of the crater floor makes it ideal for infrared observations and solar cells placed along the rim could provide near @-@ continuous power to the observatory
about <num> kilometers from the crater lies the <num> @-@ km tall <unk> mountain a peak that is perpetually visible from the earth and which could serve as a radio relay station when suitably equipped
nasa has named the rim of shackleton as a potential candidate for its lunar outpost slated to be up and running by <year> and continuously staffed by a crew by <year>
the location would promote self @-@ sustainability for lunar residents as perpetual sunlight on the south pole would provide energy for solar panels
furthermore the shadowed polar regions are believed to contain the frozen water necessary for human consumption and could also be harvested for fuel manufacture

principal photography took place between december <year> and february <year> on soundstages at the warner bros

lester 's closing narration describes meaningful experiences during his life he says that despite his death he is happy because there is so much beauty in the world
described by many as about the meaning of life or the hollow existence of the american suburbs the film has defied categorization by even the filmmakers
mendes is indecisive saying the script seemed to be about something different each time he read it a mystery story a kaleidoscopic journey through american suburbia a series of love stories
it was about imprisonment
loneliness and beauty
it was funny it was angry sad
the literary critic and author wayne c
booth concludes that the film <unk> any one interpretation american beauty cannot be adequately summarized as here is a satire on what 's wrong with american life that plays down the celebration of beauty
it is more tempting to <unk> it as a portrait of the beauty underlying american miseries and misdeeds but that plays down the scenes of cruelty and horror and ball 's disgust with our <unk>
it cannot be summarized with either lester or ricky 's philosophical statements about what life is or how one should live
he argues that the problem of interpreting the film is tied with that of finding its center — a controlling voice who unites all of the choices
he contends that in american beauty 's case it is neither mendes nor ball
mendes considers the voice to be ball 's but even while the writer was strongly influential on set he often had to accept deviations from his vision particularly ones that transformed the cynical tone of his script into something more optimistic
with innumerable voices intruding on the original author 's booth says those who interpret american beauty have forgotten to probe for the elusive center
according to booth the film 's true controller is the creative energy that hundreds of people put into its production agreeing and disagreeing inserting and cutting
the monotony of lester 's existence is established through his gray nondescript workplace and <unk> clothing
in these scenes he is often framed as if trapped reiterating rituals that hardly please him
he <unk> in the confines of his shower the shower stall evokes a jail cell and the shot is the first of many where lester is confined behind bars or within frames such as when he is reflected behind columns of numbers on a computer monitor confined and nearly crossed out
the academic and author jody w
<unk> argues that lester 's journey is the story 's center
his sexual <unk> through meeting angela is the first of several turning points as he begins to throw off the responsibilities of the comfortable life he has come to despise
after lester shares a joint with ricky his spirit is released and he begins to rebel against carolyn
changed by ricky 's attractive profound confidence lester is convinced that angela is <unk> and sees that he must question his <unk> <unk> <unk> suburban existence he takes a job at a fast @-@ food outlet which allows him to regress to a point when he could see his whole life ahead of him
when lester is caught <unk> by carolyn his angry <unk> about their lack of intimacy is the first time he says aloud what he thinks about her
by confronting the issue and carolyn 's superficial investments in others lester is trying to regain a voice in a home that only respects the voices of mother and daughter
his final turning point comes when angela and he almost have sex after she confesses her virginity he no longer thinks of her as a sex object but as a daughter
he holds her close and wraps her up
mendes called it the most satisfying end to lester 's journey there could possibly have been
with these final scenes mendes intended to show lester at the conclusion of a mythical quest
after lester gets a beer from the refrigerator the camera pushes toward him then stops facing a <unk> down which he walks to meet his fate
having begun to act his age again lester achieves closure
as he smiles at a family photo the camera pans slowly from lester to the kitchen wall onto which blood <unk> as a gunshot rings out the slow pan reflects the peace of lester 's death
his body is discovered by jane and ricky
mendes said that ricky 's staring into lester 's dead eyes is the culmination of the theme of the film that beauty is found where it is least expected
the film argues the case against conformity but does not deny that people need and want it even the gay characters just want to fit in
jim and jim the <unk> other neighbors are a satire of gay bourgeois <unk> who invest in the <unk> sameness that the film criticizes in heterosexual couples

<unk> argues that american beauty uses its art house trappings to direct its message of nonconformity primarily to the middle classes and that this approach is a cliché of bourgeois preoccupation
the underlying premise being that the luxury of finding an individual self through denial and renunciation is always open to those wealthy enough to choose and sly enough to present themselves sympathetically as a rebel
professor roy m
<unk> argues that the film 's thematic center is its direction to the audience to look closer
the opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the <unk> neighborhood with lester 's narrated admission that he will soon die forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them
it also sets a series of mysteries <unk> asks from what place exactly and from what state of being is he telling this story if he 's already dead why bother with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive there is also the question of how lester has died — or will die
<unk> believes the preceding scene — jane 's discussion with ricky about the possibility of his killing her father — adds further mystery
professor ann c
hall disagrees she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery the film allows the audience to put it aside to view the film and its philosophical issues
through this examination of lester 's life rebirth and death american beauty satirizes american middle class notions of meaning beauty and satisfaction
even lester 's transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with angela he therefore remains a willing devotee of the popular media 's <unk> of <unk> male sexuality as a sensible route to personal <unk>
carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of happiness from her belief in house beautiful domestic bliss to her car and gardening outfit carolyn 's domain is a fetching american <unk> vision of <unk> or eden
the <unk> are unaware that they are <unk> philosophically and devout consumers <unk> who expect the rudiments of american beauty to give them happiness
<unk> argues that they are helpless in the face of the prettified economic and sexual stereotypes
that they and their culture have designated for their salvation
the film presents ricky as its visionary
spiritual and mystical center
he sees beauty in the minutiae of everyday life <unk> as much as he can for fear of missing it
he shows jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed a plastic bag tossing in the wind in front of a wall
he says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was an entire life behind things he feels that sometimes there 's so much beauty in the world i feel like i can 't take it
and my heart is going to cave in
<unk> argues that ricky in looking past the cultural <unk> has grasped the radiant splendor of the created world to see god
as the film progresses the <unk> move closer to ricky 's view of the world
lester only <unk> personal satisfaction at the film 's end
on the <unk> of having sex with angela he returns to himself after she admits her virginity
suddenly confronted with a child he begins to treat her as a daughter in doing so lester sees himself angela and his family for the poor and fragile but wondrous creatures they are
he looks at a picture of his family in happier times and dies having had an epiphany that infuses him with wonder joy and soul @-@ shaking gratitude — he has finally seen the world as it is
according to patti <unk> colors are used symbolically throughout the film none more so than red which is an important thematic signature that drives the story and defines lester 's arc
first seen in drab colors that reflect his passivity lester surrounds himself with red as he <unk> his individuality
the american beauty rose is repeatedly used as symbol when lester <unk> about angela she is usually naked and surrounded by rose <unk>
in these scenes the rose symbolizes lester 's desire for her
when associated with carolyn the rose represents a façade for suburban success
roses are included in almost every shot inside the <unk> home where they signify a mask covering a bleak unbeautiful reality
carolyn feels that as long as there can be roses all is well
she cuts the roses and puts them in vases where they adorn her <unk> vision of what makes for beauty and begin to die
the roses in the vase in the angela – lester seduction scene symbolize lester 's previous life and carolyn the camera pushes in as lester and angela get closer finally taking the roses — and thus carolyn — out of the shot
lester 's epiphany at the end of the film is expressed by rain and the use of red building to a crescendo that is a deliberate contrast to the release lester feels
the constant use of red <unk> the audience <unk> into becoming used to it consequently it leaves the audience unprepared when lester is shot and his blood <unk> on the wall
lester 's attempts to relive his youth are a direct result of his lust for angela and the state of his relationship with carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact
also sexually frustrated carolyn has an affair that takes her from cold perfectionist to a more carefree soul who sings happily along with the music in her car
jane and angela constantly reference sex through angela 's descriptions of her supposed sexual encounters and the way the girls address each other
their nude scenes are used to communicate their vulnerability
by the end of the film angela 's hold on jane has weakened until the only power she has over her friend is lester 's attraction to her
col
<unk> reacts with disgust to meeting jim and jim he asks how come these faggots always have to rub it in your face how can they be so shameless to which ricky replies that 's the thing dad — they don 't feel like it 's anything to be ashamed of
<unk> argues that col
<unk> reaction is not <unk> but an <unk> self @-@ <unk>
with other turn @-@ of @-@ the @-@ millennium films such as fight club in the company of men <year> american <unk> <year> and boys don 't cry <year> american beauty raises the broader widely explored issue of masculinity in crisis
professor vincent <unk> charges that in their reinforcement of masculinity against threats posed by war by consumerism and by feminist and <unk> challenges these films present a need to focus on and even to privilege aspects of <unk> deemed deviant
lester 's transformation conveys that he and not the woman has borne the brunt of lack of being and he will not stand for being emasculated
lester 's attempts to strengthen traditional masculinity conflict with his responsibilities as a father
although the film portrays the way lester returns to that role positively he does not become the <unk> figure implicitly celebrated in films like fight club
<unk> concludes that lester 's behavior toward angela is a misguided but nearly necessary step toward his becoming a father again
<unk> says the film explicitly affirms the importance of upholding the prohibition against incest a recurring theme of ball 's work is his comparison of the <unk> against incest and homosexuality
instead of making an overt distinction american beauty looks at how their repression can lead to violence
col
<unk> is so ashamed of his homosexuality that it drives him to murder lester
ball said the movie is in part about how homophobia is based in fear and repression and about what they can do
the film implies two unfulfilled <unk> desires lester 's pursuit of angela is a manifestation of his lust for his own daughter while col
<unk> repression is exhibited through the almost sexualized discipline with which he controls ricky
consequently ricky realizes that he can only hurt his father by falsely telling him he is homosexual while angela 's vulnerability and submission to lester reminds him of his responsibilities and the limits of his fantasy
col
<unk> represents ball 's father whose repressed homosexual desires led to his own unhappiness
ball rewrote col
<unk> to delay revealing him as homosexual which <unk> reads as a possible <unk> of ball 's own patriarchal @-@ incest fantasies
although the plot spans one year the film is narrated by lester at the moment of his death
jacqueline <unk> says that the plot occupies
no time or all time citing lester 's claim that life did not flash before his eyes but that it stretches on forever like an ocean of time
<unk> argues that a rhythm of repetition forms the core of the film 's structure
for example two scenes have the <unk> sitting down to an evening meal shot from the same angle
each image is broadly similar with minor differences in object placement and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought on by lester 's new @-@ found assertiveness
another example is the pair of scenes in which jane and ricky film each other
ricky films jane from his bedroom window as she removes her bra and the image is reversed later for a similarly <unk> and <unk> scene in which jane films ricky at a vulnerable moment
lester 's fantasies are emphasized by <unk> and repetitive @-@ motion shots mendes uses double @-@ and @-@ triple <unk> in several sequences and the score alters to make the audience aware that it is entering a fantasy
one example is the gymnasium scene — lester 's first encounter with angela
while the <unk> perform their half @-@ time routine to on broadway lester becomes increasingly <unk> on angela
time slows to represent his <unk> hypnosis and lester begins to <unk> that angela 's performance is for him alone
on broadway — which provides a conventional underscore to the onscreen action — is replaced by discordant percussive music that lacks melody or progression
this <unk> score is important to creating the narrative <unk> in the sequence it conveys a moment for lester that is stretched to an indeterminate length
the effect is one that stan link likens to vertical time described by the composer and music theorist jonathan kramer as music that <unk> a single present stretched out into an enormous duration a potentially infinite now that nonetheless feels like an instant
the music is used like a visual cue so that lester and the score are staring at angela
the sequence ends with the sudden reintroduction of on broadway and <unk> time
according to drew miller of stylus the soundtrack gives unconscious voice to the characters <unk> and complements the subtext
the most obvious use of pop music accompanies and gives context to lester 's attempts to recapture his youth reminiscent of how the counterculture of the <num> <unk> american repression through music and drugs lester begins to smoke cannabis and listen to rock music
mendes song choices progress through the history of american popular music
miller argues that although some may be over familiar there is a <unk> element at work making good on the film 's encouragement that viewers look closer
toward the end of the film thomas newman 's score features more prominently creating a disturbing tempo that matches the tension of the visuals
the exception is don 't let it bring you down which plays during angela 's seduction of lester
at first appropriate its tone clashes as the seduction stops
the lyrics which speak of castles burning can be seen as a metaphor for lester 's view of angela — the rosy fantasy @-@ driven exterior of the american beauty — as it burns away to reveal the timid small @-@ breasted girl who like his wife has <unk> developed a false public self
he joined the united talent agency where his representative andrew <unk> suggested he write a spec script to <unk> himself to the town as a screenwriter
ball pitched three ideas to <unk> two conventional romantic comedies and american beauty which he had originally conceived as a play in the early <num>
despite the story 's lack of an easily marketable concept <unk> selected american beauty because he felt it was the one for which ball had the most passion
while developing the script ball created another television sitcom oh grow up
he channeled his anger and frustration at having to <unk> to network demands on that show — and during his <unk> on grace under fire and <unk> — into writing american beauty
ball did not expect to sell the script believing it would act as more of a calling card but american beauty drew interest from several production bodies
<unk> passed the script to several producers including dan <unk> and bruce cohen who took it to dreamworks
with the help of executives glenn williamson and bob cooper and steven spielberg in his capacity as studio partner ball was convinced to develop the project at dreamworks he received assurances from the studio — known at the time for its more conventional fare — that it would not iron the edges out
in an unusual move dreamworks decided not to option the script instead in april <year> the studio bought it outright for <num> @,@ <num> <unk> fox searchlight pictures october films metro @-@ goldwyn @-@ mayer and lakeshore entertainment
dreamworks planned to make the film for <num> – <num> million
<unk> and cohen involved ball throughout the film 's development including casting and director selection
the producers met with about <num> interested directors several of whom were considered a @-@ list at the time
ball was not keen on the more well @-@ known directors because he believed their involvement would increase the budget and lead dreamworks to become nervous about the content
nevertheless the studio offered the film to mike nichols and robert <unk> neither accepted
in the same year mendes then a theater director revived the musical cabaret in new york with fellow director rob marshall
beth <unk> of the creative artists agency arranged meetings for mendes with studio figures in los angeles to see if film direction was a possibility
mendes came across american beauty in a pile of eight scripts at <unk> 's house and knew immediately that it was the one he wanted to make early in his career he had been inspired by how the film paris texas <year> presented contemporary america as a mythic landscape and he saw the same theme in american beauty as well as parallels with his own childhood
mendes later met with spielberg impressed by mendes productions of oliver and cabaret spielberg encouraged him to consider american beauty
mendes found that he still had to convince dreamworks production executives to let him direct
he had already discussed the film with <unk> and cohen and felt they supported him
ball was also keen having seen cabaret he was impressed with mendes keen visual sense and thought he did not make obvious choices
ball felt that mendes liked to look under the story 's surface a talent he felt would be a good fit with the themes of american beauty
mendes background also reassured him because of the prominent role the playwright usually has in a theater production
over two meetings — the first with cooper walter <unk> and laurie macdonald the second with cooper alone — mendes pitched himself to the studio
the studio soon approached mendes with a deal to direct for the minimum salary allowed under directors guild of america rules — <num> @,@ <num>
mendes accepted and later recalled that after taxes and his agent 's commission he only earned <num> @,@ <num>
in june <year> dreamworks confirmed that it had contracted mendes to direct the film
in about <year> – <num> ball saw a plastic bag blowing in the wind outside the world trade center
he watched the bag for <num> minutes saying later that it provoked an unexpected emotional response
in <year> ball became preoccupied with the media circus around the amy fisher trial
discovering a comic book telling of the scandal he was struck by how quickly it had become <unk>
he said he felt like there was a real story underneath that was more fascinating and way more tragic than the story presented to the public and attempted to turn the idea into a play
ball produced around <num> pages but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film
he felt that because of the visual themes and because each character 's story was
intensely personal it could not be done on a stage
all the main characters appeared in this version but carolyn did not feature strongly jim and jim instead had much larger roles
ball based lester 's story on aspects of his own life
lester 's re @-@ examination of his life parallels feelings ball had in his mid @-@ <num> like lester ball put aside his passions to work in jobs he hated for people he did not respect
scenes in ricky 's household reflect ball 's own childhood experiences
ball suspected his father was homosexual and used the idea to create col
<unk> a man who gave up his chance to be himself
ball said the script 's mix of comedy and drama was not intentional but that it came <unk> from his own outlook on life
he said the juxtaposition produced a <unk> contrast giving each trait more impact than if they appeared alone
in the script that was sent to prospective actors and directors lester and angela had sex by the time of shooting ball had rewritten the scene to the final version
ball initially rebuffed counsel from others that he change the script feeling they were being <unk> the final impetus to alter the scene came from dreamworks then @-@ president walter <unk>
he convinced ball by indicating that in greek mythology the hero has a moment of epiphany before
tragedy occurs
ball later said his anger when writing the first draft had blinded him to the idea that lester needed to refuse sex with angela to complete his emotional journey — to achieve redemption
<unk> and cohen asked ball not to alter the scene right away as they felt it would be inappropriate to make changes to the script before a director had been hired
early drafts also included a flashback to col
<unk> service in the marines a sequence that unequivocally established his homosexual <unk>
in love with another marine col
<unk> sees the man die and comes to believe that he is being punished for the sin of being gay
ball removed the sequence because it did not fit the structure of the rest of the film — col
<unk> was the only character to have a flashback — and because it removed the element of surprise from col
<unk> later pass at lester
ball said he had to write it for his own benefit to know what happened to col
<unk> though all that remained in later drafts was subtext
ball remained involved throughout production he had signed a television show development deal so had to get permission from his producers to take a year off to be close to american beauty
ball was on @-@ set for rewrites and to help interpret his script for all but two days of filming
his original <unk> scenes — in which ricky and jane are prosecuted for lester 's murder after being framed by col
<unk> — were <unk> in post @-@ production the writer later felt the scenes were unnecessary saying they were a reflection of his anger and cynicism at the time of writing see editing
ball and mendes revised the script twice before it was sent to the actors and twice more before the first read @-@ through
the shooting script features a scene in angela 's car in which ricky and jane talk about death and beauty the scene differed from earlier versions which set it as a big scene on a freeway in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body
the change was a practical decision as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs
the schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash but only half a day was available
ball agreed but only if the scene could retain a line of ricky 's where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman when you see something like that it 's like god is looking right at you just for a second
and if you 're careful you can look right back
jane asks and what do you see ricky beauty
ball said they wanted to cut that scene
they said it 's not important
i said you 're out of your fucking mind
it 's one of the most important scenes in the movie
if any one line is the heart and soul of this movie that is the line
another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence set in a schoolyard it presents a turning point for jane in that she chooses to walk home with ricky instead of going with angela
by the end of filming the script had been through <num> drafts
the studio suggested several alternatives including bruce willis kevin costner or john <unk> to play lester and helen hunt or holly hunter to play carolyn
mendes did not want a big star weighing the film down he felt spacey was the right choice based on his performances in the <year> films the usual suspects and seven and <year> 's <unk> glen ross
spacey was surprised he said i usually play characters who are very quick very manipulative and smart

i usually wade in dark sort of <unk> waters
this is a man living one step at a time playing by his instincts
this is actually much closer to me to what i am than those other parts
mendes offered <unk> the role of carolyn without the studio 's consent although executives were upset at mendes by september <year> dreamworks had entered negotiations with spacey and <unk>
spacey loosely based lester 's early <unk> <unk> on walter <unk>
during the film lester 's physique improves from <unk> to toned spacey worked out during filming to improve his body but because mendes shot the scenes out of chronological order spacey varied postures to portray the stages
before filming mendes and spacey analyzed jack <unk> 's performance in the apartment <year> because mendes wanted spacey to emulate the way <unk> moved the way he looked the way he was in that office and the way he was an ordinary man and yet a special man
spacey 's voiceover is a throwback to sunset boulevard <year> which is also narrated in retrospect by a dead character
mendes felt it evoked lester 's — and the film 's — loneliness
<unk> recalled women from her youth to inform her performance i used to babysit constantly
you 'd go to church and see how people present themselves on the outside and then be inside their house and see the difference
<unk> and a hair stylist collaborated to create a <unk> president <unk> hairstyle and mendes and production designer <unk> <unk> researched mail @-@ order <unk> to better establish carolyn 's environment of a spotless suburban manor
to help <unk> get into carolyn 's mindset mendes gave her music that he believed carolyn would like
he lent <unk> the bobby <unk> version of the song don 't rain on my parade which she enjoyed and persuaded the director to include it for a scene in which carolyn sings in her car
for the roles of jane ricky and angela dreamworks gave mendes carte blanche
by november <year> thora birch wes bentley and mena suvari had been cast in the parts — in birch 's case despite the fact she was underage for her nude scene
as birch was <num> at the time she made the film and thus classified as a minor in the united states her parents had to approve her brief topless scene in the movie
child labor representatives and they were on the set for the shooting of the scene
bentley overcame competition from top actors under the age of <num> to be cast
the <year> documentary my big break followed bentley and several other young actors before and after he landed the part
to prepare mendes provided bentley with a video camera telling the actor to film what ricky would
peter gallagher and alison <unk> were cast as buddy kane and barbara <unk> after filming began in december <year>
mendes gave <unk> a book of paintings by edvard <unk>
he told her your character is in there somewhere
mendes cut much of barbara 's dialogue including conversations between colonel <unk> and her as he felt that what needed to be said about the pair — their humanity and vulnerability — was conveyed successfully through their shared moments of silence
chris cooper plays colonel <unk> scott bakula plays jim <unk> and sam <unk> plays jim berkley
jim and jim were deliberately depicted as the most normal happy — and boring — couple in the film
ball 's inspiration for the characters came from a thought he had after seeing a bland boring heterosexual couple who wore matching clothes i can 't wait for the time when a gay couple can be just as boring
ball also included aspects of a gay couple he knew who had the same forename
mendes insisted on two weeks of cast rehearsals although the sessions were not as formal as he was used to in the theater and the actors could not be present at every one
several <unk> and suggestions by the actors were incorporated into the script
an early scene showing the <unk> leaving home for work was inserted later on to show the low point that carolyn and lester 's relationship had reached
spacey and <unk> worked to create a sense of the love that lester and carolyn once had for one another for example the scene in which lester almost <unk> carolyn after the pair argues over lester 's buying a car was originally strictly contentious
american beauty was filmed on soundstages at the warner bros
backlot in burbank california and at hancock park and <unk> in los angeles
the aerial shots at the beginning and end of the film were captured in sacramento california and many of the school scenes were shot at south high school in torrance california several extras in the gym crowd were south high students
the film is set in an upper middle @-@ class neighborhood in an unidentified american town
production designer <unk> <unk> likened the locale to evanston illinois but said it 's not about a place it 's about an archetype

the milieu was pretty much anywhere usa — <unk> mobile suburbia
the intent was for the setting to reflect the characters who are also archetypes
<unk> said all of them are very strained and their lives are constructs
the <unk> household was designed as the reverse of the <unk> — the former a pristine ideal but <unk> and lacking in inner balance leading to carolyn 's desire to at least give it the appearance of a perfect all @-@ american household the <unk> home is depicted in exaggerated darkness and symmetry
the production selected two adjacent properties on the warner backlot 's <unk> street for the burnham and <unk> homes
the crew rebuilt the houses to incorporate false rooms that established lines of sight — between ricky and jane 's bedroom windows and between ricky 's bedroom and lester 's garage
the garage windows were designed specifically to obtain the crucial shot toward the end of the film in which col
<unk> — watching from ricky 's bedroom — mistakenly assumes that lester is paying ricky for sex
mendes made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make the audience feel a sense of familiarity with the shot
the house interiors were filmed on the backlot on location and on soundstages when overhead shots were needed
the inside of the <unk> home was shot at a house close to interstate <num> and sunset boulevard in los angeles the inside of the <unk> home was shot in the city 's hancock park neighborhood
ricky 's bedroom was designed to be cell @-@ like to suggest his <unk> personality while at the same time blending with the high @-@ tech equipment to reflect his <unk> side
the production deliberately minimized the use of red as it was an important thematic signature elsewhere
the <unk> home uses cool blues while the <unk> is kept in a depressed military palette
mendes dominating visual style was deliberate and composed with a minimalist design that provided a sparse almost surreal feeling — a bright crisp hard edged near <unk> @-@ like take on american suburbia mendes constantly directed his set <unk> to empty the frame
he made lester 's fantasy scenes more fluid and graceful and mendes made minimal use of <unk> feeling that stable shots generated more tension
for example when mendes used a slow push in to the <unk> dinner table he held the shot because his training as a theater director taught him the importance of putting distance between the characters
he wanted to keep the tension in the scene so he only cut away when jane left the table
mendes did use a hand @-@ held camera for the scene in which col
<unk> beats ricky
mendes said the camera provided the scene with a kinetic
off @-@ balance energy
he also went hand @-@ held for the excerpts of ricky 's camcorder footage
mendes took a long time to get the quality of ricky 's footage to the level he wanted
for the plastic @-@ bag footage mendes used wind machines to move the bag in the air
the scene took four takes two by the second unit did not satisfy mendes so he shot the scene himself
he felt his first take lacked grace but for the last attempt he changed the location to the front of a brick wall and added leaves on the ground
mendes was satisfied by the way the wall gave definition to the outline of the bag
mendes avoided using close @-@ ups as he believed the technique was <unk> he also cited spielberg 's advice that he should imagine an audience silhouetted at the bottom of the camera monitor to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a <num> @-@ foot <num> m screen
spielberg — who visited the set a few times — also advised mendes not to worry about costs if he had a great idea toward the end of a long working day
mendes said that happened three or four times and they are all in the movie
despite spielberg 's support dreamworks and mendes fought constantly over the schedule and budget although the studio interfered little with the film 's content
spacey <unk> and hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates
american beauty cost dreamworks <num> million to produce slightly above their projected sum
mendes was so dissatisfied with his first three days filming that he obtained permission from dreamworks to reshoot the scenes
he said i started with a wrong scene actually a comedy scene
and the actors played it way too big
it was badly shot my fault badly composed my fault bad costumes my fault
and everybody was doing what i was asking
it was all my fault
aware that he was a novice mendes drew on the experience of hall i made a very conscious decision early on if i didn 't understand something technically to say without embarrassment i don 't understand what you 're talking about please explain it
mendes encouraged some improvisation for example when lester <unk> in bed beside carolyn the director asked spacey to improvise several euphemisms for the act in each take
mendes said i wanted that not just because it was funny
but because i didn 't want it to seem rehearsed
i wanted it to seem like he was <unk> it out of his mouth without thinking
spacey is so in control — i wanted him to break through
spacey obliged eventually coming up with <num> phrases but <unk> could not always keep a straight face which meant the scene had to be shot <num> times
the production used small amounts of computer @-@ generated imagery
most of the rose <unk> in lester 's fantasies were added in post @-@ production although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed
when lester <unk> about angela in a rose @-@ petal bath the steam was real save for in the overhead shot
to position the camera a hole had to be cut in the ceiling through which the steam escaped it was instead added digitally
mendes and an assistant edited the film for <num> days between the appointments
mendes realized during editing that the film was different from the one he had envisioned
he believed he had been making a much more whimsical
kaleidoscopic film than what came together in the edit suite
instead mendes was drawn to the emotion and darkness he began to use the score and shots he had intended to discard to craft the film along these lines
in total he cut about <num> minutes from his original edit
the opening included a dream in which lester imagines himself flying above the town
mendes spent two days filming spacey against <unk> but removed the sequence as he believed it to be too whimsical — like a coen brothers movie — and therefore inappropriate for the tone he was trying to set
the opening in the final cut reused a scene from the middle of the film where jane tells ricky to kill her father
this scene was to be the revelation to the audience that the pair was not responsible for lester 's death as the way it was scored and acted made it clear that jane 's request was not serious
however in the portion he used in the opening — and when the full scene plays out later — mendes used the score and a reaction shot of ricky to leave a lingering ambiguity as to his guilt
the subsequent shot — an aerial view of the neighborhood — was originally intended as the plate shot for the <unk> effects in the dream sequence
mendes spent more time <unk> the first <num> minutes than the rest of the film taken together
he <unk> several versions of the opening the first edit included <unk> scenes in which jane and ricky are convicted of lester 's murder but mendes <unk> these in the last week of editing because he felt they made the film lose its mystery and because they did not fit with the theme of redemption that had emerged during production
mendes believed the trial drew focus away from the characters and turned the film into an episode of nypd blue
instead he wanted the ending to be a poetic mixture of dream and memory and narrative resolution
when ball first saw a completed edit it was a version with truncated versions of these scenes
he felt that they were so short that they didn 't really register
mendes and he argued but ball was more accepting after mendes cut the sequences completely ball felt that without the scenes the film was more optimistic and had evolved into something that for all its darkness had a really romantic heart
instead mendes asked fred elmes who turned the job down because he did not like the script
hall was recommended to mendes by tom cruise because of hall 's work on without limits <year> which cruise had executive produced
mendes was directing cruise 's then @-@ wife nicole kidman in the play the blue room during <unk> on american beauty and had already <unk> the whole film
hall was involved for one month during <unk> his ideas for lighting the film began with his first reading of the script and further passes allowed him to refine his approach before meeting mendes
hall was initially concerned that audiences would not like the characters he only felt able to identify with them during cast rehearsals which gave him fresh ideas on his approach to the visuals
hall 's approach was to create peaceful compositions that evoked <unk> to contrast with the turbulent on @-@ screen events and allow audiences to take in the action
hall and mendes first discussed the intended mood of a scene but he was allowed to light the shot in any way he felt necessary
in most cases hall first lit the scene 's subject by painting in the blacks and whites before adding fill light which he reflected from <unk> or white card on the ceiling
this approach gave hall more control over the shadows while keeping the fill light unobtrusive and the dark areas free of spill
hall shot american beauty in a <num>
<num> <num> aspect ratio in the super <num> format using <unk> vision <unk> <num> <num> mm film stock
he used super <num> partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as the corners of the petal @-@ filled pool in its overhead shot creating a frame around angela within
he shot the whole film at the same t @-@ stop t1
<num> given his preference for shooting that wide hall favored high @-@ speed stocks to allow for more subtle lighting effects
he used <unk> platinum cameras with the company 's primo series of prime and zoom lenses
hall employed <unk> vision <unk> <num> and <unk> <num> stock for scenes with daylight effects
he had difficulty adjusting to <unk> 's newly introduced vision release print stock which combined with his contrast @-@ heavy lighting style created a look with too much contrast
hall contacted <unk> who sent him a batch of <num> that was <num> lower in contrast
hall used a <num> <num> inch <unk> black <unk> filter for almost every scene which he said in retrospect may not have been the best choice as the optical steps required to blow super <num> up for its anamorphic release print led to a slight amount of degradation therefore the diffusion from the filter was not required
when he saw the film in a theater hall felt that the image was slightly unclear and that had he not used the filter the diffusion from the super <num> – anamorphic conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended
a shot where lester and ricky share a cannabis joint behind a building came from a misunderstanding between hall and mendes
mendes asked hall to prepare the shot in his absence hall assumed the characters would look for privacy so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building intending to light from the top of the truck
when mendes returned he explained that the characters did not care if they were seen
he removed the truck and hall had to rethink the lighting he lit it from the left with a large light crossing the actors and with a soft light behind the camera
hall felt the consequent wide shot worked perfectly for the tone of the scene
hall made sure to keep rain or the suggestion of it in every shot near the end of the film
in one shot during lester 's encounter with angela at the <unk> home hall created rain effects on the foreground cross lights in another he partly lit the pair through french windows to which he had added material to make the rain run slower intensifying the light although the strength of the outside light was unrealistic for a night scene hall felt it justified because of the strong contrasts it produced
for the close @-@ ups when lester and angela move to the couch hall tried to keep rain in the frame lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind lester
he also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room
he mainly used percussion instruments to create the mood and rhythm the inspiration for which was provided by mendes
newman favored pulse rhythm and color over melody making for a more minimalist score than he had previously created
he built each cue around small <unk> repeating phrases — often the only variety through a thinning of the texture for eight bars
the percussion instruments included <unk> <unk> <unk> piano <unk> and <unk> also featured were guitars flute and world music instruments
newman also used electronic music and on quirkier tracks employed more unorthodox methods such as tapping metal mixing bowls with a finger and using a detuned mandolin
newman believed the score helped move the film along without disturbing the moral ambiguity of the script it was a real delicate balancing act in terms of what music worked to preserve that
the soundtrack features songs by newman bobby <unk> the who free <unk> the guess who bill withers betty carter peggy lee the folk implosion gomez and bob dylan as well as two cover versions — the beatles because performed by elliott smith and neil young 's don 't let it bring you down performed by annie lennox

dreamworks made around one million copies available for rental blockbuster 's share would usually have been about <num> @,@ <num> of these
some blockbuster stores only displayed <num> copies and others did not display the film at all forcing customers to ask for it

all the extras from the dvd release were present with the theatrical trailers upgraded to hd

it was the best @-@ received title at the toronto international film festival <unk> where it won the people 's choice award after a ballot of the festival 's audiences
<unk> 's director piers handling said american beauty was the <unk> of the festival the film most talked @-@ about
writing in variety todd mccarthy said the cast ensemble could not be better he praised spacey 's handling of innuendo subtle sarcasm and blunt talk and the way he imbued lester with genuine feeling
janet maslin in the new york times said spacey was at his wittiest and most agile to date and roger ebert of the chicago sun @-@ times singled spacey out for successfully portraying a man who does reckless and foolish things but who doesn 't deceive himself
kevin jackson of sight sound said spacey impressed in ways distinct from his previous performances the most satisfying aspect being his portrayal of both sap and hero
writing in film quarterly gary <unk> praised the actors but said that characters such as carolyn and col
<unk> were stereotypes
<unk> accused mendes and ball of identifying too readily with jane and ricky saying the latter was their fantasy figure — a <unk> boy who 's an <unk> wealthy artist able to finance his own projects
<unk> said angela was the most believable teenager in particular with her painfully familiar attempts to live up to an unworthy image of herself
maslin agreed that some characters were unoriginal but said their detailed characterizations made them memorable
kenneth <unk> of the los angeles times said the actors <unk> <unk> with what were difficult roles he called spacey 's performance the energy that drives the film saying the actor commanded audience involvement despite lester not always being sympathetic
against considerable odds we do like these characters <unk> concluded
maslin felt that mendes directed with terrific visual flair saying his minimalist style balanced the mordant and bright and that he evoked the delicate <unk> power @-@ playing vignettes of his theater work
jackson said mendes theatrical roots rarely showed and that the most remarkable aspect was that spacey 's performance did not overshadow the film
he said that mendes worked the script 's intricacies smoothly to the ensemble 's strengths and staged the tonal shifts <unk>
mccarthy believed american beauty a stunning card of introduction for film <unk> mendes and ball
he said mendes sure hand was as precise and controlled as his theater work
mccarthy cited hall 's involvement as fortunate for mendes as the cinematographer was <unk> at conveying the themes of a work
<unk> agreed that mendes choice of collaborators was shrewd naming hall and newman in particular
<unk> suggested that american beauty may have benefited from mendes inexperience as his anything 's possible daring made him attempt beats that more seasoned directors might have avoided
<unk> felt that mendes accomplishment was to capture and enhance the duality of ball 's script — the simultaneously <unk>
and painfully real characters
<unk> while critical of many of mendes and ball 's choices admitted the film showed off their considerable talents
<unk> cited ball 's lack of constraint when writing the film as the reason for its uniqueness in particular the script 's subtle changes in tone
mccarthy said the script was as fresh and distinctive as any of its american film contemporaries and praised how it analyzed the characters while not compromising narrative pace
he called ball 's dialogue tart and said the characters — carolyn <unk> — were deeply drawn
one other flaw mccarthy said was the revelation of col
<unk> homosexuality which he said evoked hoary <unk>
jackson said the film transcended its clichéd setup to become a wonderfully resourceful and sombre comedy
he said that even when the film played for sitcom laughs it did so with unexpected nuance
<unk> criticized how the film made a mystery of lester 's murder believing it manipulative and simply a way of generating suspense
mccarthy cited the production and costume design as <unk> and said the soundtrack was good at creating ironic counterpoint s to the story
<unk> concluded that american beauty was vital but uneven he felt the film 's examination of the ways which teenagers and adults imagine each other 's lives was its best point and that although lester and angela 's dynamic was familiar its romantic irony stood beside the most enduring literary treatments of the theme such as <unk>
nevertheless <unk> believed that the film 's themes of materialism and conformity in american suburbia were <unk>
mccarthy conceded that the setting was familiar but said it merely provided the film with a starting point from which to tell its subtle and <unk> judged tale
maslin agreed she said that while it takes aim at targets that are none too fresh and that the theme of nonconformity did not surprise the film had its own corrosive novelty
ebert awarded american beauty four stars out of four and <unk> said it was layered subversive complex and surprising concluding it was a hell of a picture
a few months after the film 's release reports of a backlash appeared in the american press and the years since have seen its critical regard <unk>
in <year> premiere named american beauty as one of <num> most <unk> movies of all time mendes accepted the <unk> of the critical reappraisal saying i thought some of it was entirely justified — it was a little <unk> at the time
currently the film holds an <num> score on rotten tomatoes based on <num> reviews with an average rating of <num>
<num> <num> the critical consensus reads <unk> cast and brimming with dark acid wit american beauty is a smart provocative high point of late <num> mainstream hollywood film
metacritic gives the film a score of <num> based on <num> reviews indicating universal acclaim
several other contenders opened at the end of <year> and us critics spread their honors among them when compiling their end @-@ of @-@ year lists
the chicago film critics association and the broadcast film critics association named the film the best of <year> but while the new york film critics circle the national society of film critics and the los angeles film critics association recognized american beauty they gave their top awards to other films
by the end of the year reports of a critical backlash suggested american beauty was the underdog in the race for best picture however at the golden globe awards in january <year> american beauty won best film best director and best screenplay
as the nominations for the <num> academy awards approached a <unk> had not emerged
dreamworks had launched a major campaign for american beauty five weeks before ballots were due to be sent to the <num> @,@ <num> academy award voters
its campaign combined traditional advertising and publicity with more focused strategies
although direct mail campaigning was prohibited dreamworks reached voters by promoting the film in casual comfortable settings in voters communities
the studio 's candidate for best picture the previous year saving private ryan lost to shakespeare in love so the studio took a new approach by hiring outsiders to provide input for the campaign
it hired three veteran consultants who told the studio to think small
nancy <unk> encouraged dreamworks to produce a special about the making of american beauty to set up displays of the film in the communities bookstores and to arrange a question @-@ and @-@ answer session with mendes for the british academy of film and television arts
dale olson advised the studio to advertise in free publications that circulated in beverly hills — home to many voters — in addition to major newspapers
olson arranged to screen american beauty to about <num> @,@ <num> members of the actors fund of america as many participating actors were also voters
bruce feldman took ball to the santa barbara international film festival where ball attended a private dinner in honor of anthony hopkins meeting several voters who were in attendance
in february <year> american beauty was nominated for eight academy awards its closest rivals the cider house rules and the insider received seven nominations each
in march <year> the major industry labor organizations all awarded their top honors to american beauty perceptions had shifted — the film was now the favorite to dominate the academy awards
american beauty 's closest rival for best picture was still the cider house rules from <unk>
both studios mounted aggressive campaigns dreamworks bought <num> more advertising space in variety than <unk>

gore was involved in a variety of charitable causes and was a major benefactor of harvard college where the first library was named in his honor
his palatial mansion in <unk> massachusetts now known as gore place is one of the finest extant examples of federalist architecture and has been declared a national historic landmark
he was the youngest of their three sons to survive to adulthood
he attended boston latin school and entered harvard college at the young even for the time age of thirteen
at the outset of the american revolutionary war and the siege of boston in <year> harvard 's buildings were occupied by the continental army and gore temporarily continued his studies in bradford until harvard could resume operations in concord
while at harvard gore participated in a speaking club and formed significant lifelong friendships with rufus king and john <unk>
gore graduated in <year> and promptly enlisted in the continental artillery regiment of his brother @-@ in @-@ law thomas crafts where he served as a clerk until <year>
the gore family was divided by the war gore 's father was a loyalist who left boston when the british army evacuated the city in march <year>
gore was consequently called upon to support his mother and three sisters who remained in boston
in <year> gore successfully petitioned the state for the remaining family 's share of his father 's seized assets
gore 's law practice flourished in part because many loyalist lawyers had fled massachusetts
gore 's clients included loyalists seeking to recover some of their assets as well as london @-@ based british merchants with claims to pursue
his briefs were generally well @-@ reasoned and he was seen as a successful trial lawyer
gore grew his fortune by investing carefully in revolutionary currency and bonds
the securities he purchased were paper that had been given to continental army soldiers in lieu of pay which they often sold at a steep discount
one batch of securities he purchased for instance cost him about <num> @,@ <num> but had a face value of <num> @,@ <num>
in <year> he married rebecca <unk> payne daughter of a wealthy merchant maritime insurer and director of the bank of massachusetts
the couple were known for their social graces and became prominent members of boston society
in <year> gore became concerned about a rise in anti @-@ lawyer sentiment in massachusetts
grievances over harsh policies pursued by governor james <unk> blossomed into <unk> rebellion which required militia action to crush in <year>
gore was one of several high @-@ profile lawyers assigned to defend participants in the rebellion included in this group were theodore sedgwick caleb strong james sullivan levi lincoln sr
and thomas <unk>
although many rebels were ultimately convicted a large number received amnesty
in <year> gore was elected a delegate to the <year> massachusetts convention that ratified the united states constitution
his election was contested because boston where he lived was at the time more inclined toward state power
gore nonetheless was strongly federalist urging support of the new constitution
he took a leading role in adopting the state 's rules for actions required of it by the new federal constitution
by his proposal the legislature decided that presidential electors would be chosen by a joint session
he also proposed that the state house and senate agree by separate votes on choices for the united states senate a process that would significantly reduce popular input to the choice
his choice was ultimately rejected in favor of a process whereby the house selected a slate of candidates from which the senate would choose one
in <year> gore decided to stand for reelection but lost owing to strong anti @-@ nationalist fervor in boston at the time
he managed to win a seat later when a special election was held after resignations opened several seats
gore 's financial speculations in the late <num> significantly multiplied his wealth
in <year> he and andrew <unk> a boston businessman who had retained gore for legal services entered into a secret agreement to purchase continental securities with a face value of <num> @,@ <num> in a speculative bid that their value would rise
by late october of that year the pair had met this goal gore had purchased <num> @,@ <num> worth of paper for about <num> @,@ <num> and encouraged <unk> to purchase more than the <num> @,@ <num> he had acquired if his funding would allow for it
gore also purchased massachusetts war @-@ related debts and lobbied massachusetts congressmen for the u
s
government to assume those as well
gore 's windfall was realized when in <year> the united states congress acting on a proposal made by alexander hamilton and supported by gore 's friend rufus king passed legislation that exchanged continental and state paper for new u
s
paper at face value
not only did gore win on this exchange but the paper he received appreciated in value before he sold it
the exact amount he made is unclear from the surviving documents john quincy adams wrote that gore 's speculations made him the wealthiest lawyer in the country
the success of gore 's speculations prompted him to enter a partnership with <unk> william duer and daniel parker in an attempt to acquire u
s
foreign debt obligations on favorable terms
parker was a business partner of <unk> 's and duer was an influential new york businessman and treasury department official whose lavish lifestyle impressed gore
the partnership promoted sales of u
s
lands in europe and sought to acquire u
s
obligations to france
although gore sank <num> @,@ <num> into this venture it failed more powerful and experienced dutch bankers <unk> the americans
gore also engaged in other ventures with these partners but apparently carefully stayed with financial speculations and avoided the partners less successful land ventures
much of gore 's financial activity was mediated through the bank of massachusetts where his father @-@ in @-@ law was a director
gore himself was elected to its board in <year> when he also became a shareholder
during his time on the board the bank tightened its regulations on loan repayments a move that improved the stability of its capital
gore used the bank for most of his personal deposits but also drew on lines of credit for as much as several thousand dollars
the bank shares he held paid relatively high <unk> until <year> when the bank received serious competition from the first bank of the united states
the bank of the united states was established by alexander hamilton to provide stable banking services on a national scale and sought to open a branch in boston
hamilton recruited heavily in the bank of massachusetts and gore decided to make the move
he sold his shares in the massachusetts bank and became a director of the boston branch of the u
s
bank
he also purchased <num> shares in the new bank a relatively large investment
gore was influential in making hiring decisions for the branch and sought to merge state @-@ chartered banks into the organization arguing that only a nationally chartered bank could provide consistent and stable service
gore resigned from the board in <year> citing the demands of his law practice
gore 's financial successes enabled him to join the elite society of boston
in <year> he purchased a large mansion on fashionable <unk> square and also bought a country estate in <unk> that grew over time to <num> acres <num> ha
he had a house built on the estate most of which he operated as a gentleman farmer
he and other similarly @-@ situated <unk> formed the massachusetts society for promoting agriculture of which he served as a trustee for several years the organization was not seen as significantly contributing to advances in agriculture
gore controversially refused to resign from the state legislature arguing that the state constitution 's prohibitions against holding multiple offices did not apply to federal posts
he eventually resigned the legislative seat under protest because of pressure from his fellow legislators
gore served as district attorney until <year>
his principal matter of concern was the enforcement of u
s
neutrality with respect to the french revolutionary wars
he attempted several times to prosecute the french consul in boston antoine <unk> for <unk> and operating <unk> out of the port of boston but he was <unk> by local juries that sympathized with the french
<unk> was eventually expelled on orders from president george washington based on evidence provided by gore
gore also promoted anti @-@ french sentiment with political writings in massachusetts newspapers
writing under the pseudonym <unk> he denounced the formation of democratic societies formed to oppose federalist policy and support pro @-@ french positions
he suggested to president washington that someone be sent to england to negotiate with the british
john jay traveled to london in <year> and negotiated the jay treaty whose ratification gore vocally supported
although gore was hostile to french policy he was on friendly terms with individual frenchmen he hosted the future french statesman <unk> when he visited the u
s
in <year> washington appointed him as a commissioner representing the united states to handle maritime claims under the terms the jay treaty
as a result the <unk> moved to england that year establishing a residence in the fashionable hyde park area
the commission was established to arbitrate claims emanating from british seizures of american vessels and cargoes and from british claims relating to violations of american neutrality in the ongoing french revolutionary wars
it consisted of three americans gore william pinkney and john <unk> and two british commissioners john nicoll and nicholas astley <unk> was chosen by the other four because he was deemed to sufficiently fair @-@ minded to cast deciding votes in the event of disagreements
that year he was also elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences
although gore was well received by the british establishment the work suffered from what gore called a <unk> of process and he considered requesting a transfer in <year>
in <year> it ground to a halt because another board established by the treaty to resolve outstanding revolutionary war claims against the united states had not yet met and the british stopped the claims processing until resolution of the other issues got underway
gore used this break to briefly return to america and assess the condition of his <unk> estate where the house had been largely destroyed by fire in <year>
after his return to london with the commission work still stopped he and rebecca embarked on a tour of europe
they visited holland belgium and switzerland and spent six months in paris
during this trip and later ones in england and scotland they took note of the architecture of country estates and began planning a new house for their <unk> property
the commission resumed its work in early <year> and had resolved all outstanding claims by august <year>
it awarded <num> @,@ <num> to british claimants and over <num> million to american claimants
the lopsided result is due to the vastly larger number of american claims but also to some key early decisions that favored american interpretations in the processing of the claims and by a british administration that sought to remain in america 's good graces
the gore 's social circle in england revolved around his good friend rufus king who was appointed ambassador to great britain in <year> along with other massachusetts expatriates
when king left his post in may <year> he named gore to head the london embassy as chargé d 'affaires
although president thomas jefferson never issued a formal appointment the british government accepted his role for the two @-@ month interval between king 's departure and the arrival of james monroe as king 's replacement
the <unk> sailed for boston in the spring of <year>
rebecca gore used their exposure to european country estates to design a lavish new building for their <unk> estate during their english sojourn
designed with the assistance of french architect joseph @-@ guillaume <unk> and probably also influenced by the works of english architect sir john <unk> the house that was built upon their return to the united states in <year> now known as gore place is one of the finest extant examples of federalist architecture
he was active in the state federalist party organization sitting on its secret central committee
he resumed his law practice in which he took on as a student daniel webster
one of the highest profile cases he took on was the <year> defense of thomas selfridge accused of murdering charles austin
selfridge an older federalist attorney had been retained to assist in the collection of a debt from austin 's republican father
in the politically charged atmosphere of the day in boston selfridge fearing for his own safety had armed himself with a dueling pistol
the younger austin had apparently on his own initiative sought to beat selfridge with a cane and selfridge fatally shot him in the encounter
selfridge was prosecuted by attorney general and future gore gubernatorial opponent james sullivan and the defense also included arch @-@ federalist harrison gray otis
gore argued selfridge acted in self @-@ defense selfridge was acquitted of murder by a jury whose foreman was patriot and federalist paul revere after fifteen minutes deliberation
gore also resumed business activities upon his return
he invested in a wide variety of businesses and infrastructure spurring economic activity in the state
his investments ranged widely including maritime insurance where is father @-@ in @-@ law had made his fortune bridges locks canals and textiles
he was a major investor in the middlesex canal the <unk> bridge the first to connect boston to cambridge and the boston manufacturing company whose factory proving the single @-@ site production of textiles was in <unk> near his estate
not all of his ventures panned out the canal was in the long run a financial failure as were efforts with other collaborators to develop <unk> point the cambridge side of the <unk> bridge
the textile mill however was a success and gore invested in the <unk> manufacturing company
when it decided to locate in what is now lowell massachusetts gore purchased shares in the proprietors of locks and canals which operated and still owns today the lowell canals
in <year> gore won election to the state senate
that year the republicans were in the majority and the election for governor was close enough to require a recount
the legislature scrutinized the ballots in a partisan manner for example retaining ballots containing <unk> versions of republican james sullivan 's name and discarding similar ballots marked for federalist caleb strong
gore and other <unk> raised a public outcry and the legislature relented eventually certifying strong as the winner
gore ran unsuccessfully for governor of massachusetts in <year> and <year> against a rising tide of republicanism in the state losing both times to moderate republican james sullivan
the <unk> gained control of the state legislature in <year> in a backlash against republican economic policies but gore was criticized for his failure to aggressively support state protests against the embargo act of <year> which had a major negative effect on the state 's large merchant fleet
gore was in <year> elected to the massachusetts house of representatives where he successfully led federalist efforts to ensure the selection of a federalist slate of presidential electors
he also spearheaded actions to drive senator john quincy adams from the federalist party over his support of thomas jefferson 's foreign policy
the legislature elected adams successor nine months early and gave adams sufficiently <unk> instructions that he resigned the post and joined with the republicans
who had taken over as acting governor upon sullivan 's death late in <year>
during gore 's term the principal domestic issue occupying state politics was a banking crisis stimulated by the federal policy of <unk> trade with great britain and france then embroiled in the napoleonic wars
although the crisis caused a number of bank failures in new england massachusetts banks largely escaped unscathed
foreign policy played a major role in gore 's administration
the legislature passed resolves opposing the federal government 's hardline policy against trade and diplomatic relations with the united kingdom then embroiled in the napoleonic wars and gore in early <year> invited francis james jackson who had been rejected as the uk 's ambassador to the us to visit the state
this pressure may have played a role in president james madison 's decision to renew relations with the uk and accept jackson 's credentials
the <unk> of the war threat and the choice by the republicans of the popular elbridge gerry as their candidate brought a challenge to federalist control of massachusetts in the <year> elections
the <unk> gerry and republican partisans criticized gore for his lavish lifestyle including his palatial <unk> residence and pompous activities he organized as governor and highlighted his loyalist family connections while emphasizing gerry 's <unk> patriotism
gerry won the election
jackson did visit boston but he was greeted not by gore but gerry
gore ran against gerry again in <year> but lost in another acrimonious campaign
gore was granted an honorary law degree from harvard in <year>
he served on the college 's board of <unk> from <year> to <year> and as a fellow from <year> to <year>
harvard 's first library building a gothic structure built in <year> of quincy granite was named in his honor but was demolished when <unk> library was built in its place in <year>
this structure is found on the seal of the city of cambridge
one of the residential winthrop house 's buildings is called gore hall in his honor

he served from may <num> <year> to may <num> <year> winning reelection to the seat in <year>
he opposed the ongoing war of <year> in these years with his earlier diplomatic experience providing valuable knowledge to federalist interests
he expressed approval of the <year> hartford convention in which the new england states aired grievances concerning republican governance of the country and the conduct of the war
gore assented to the treaty of <unk> that ended the war but was unhappy that the nation had not gained anything from the war
he resigned in june <year> unhappy with the politics of washington and suffering from poor health
although he was no longer active in politics he continued to express opinions on the subjects of the day opposing the <year> missouri compromise and <unk> the great moderation <unk> of federalist governor john brooks
he was also elected a member of the american antiquarian society in <year>
gore spent most of his later years at his country estate in <unk> suffering from worsening <unk> arthritis that made walking increasingly difficult
his declining health and lack of social scene in <unk> led him in <year> to return to boston in the winters
he died on march <num> <year> in boston and is buried in its granary burying ground
gore 's wife died in <year> the couple had no children
the major <unk> of the gore estate was harvard which received an estimated <num> @,@ <num> although bequests were also made to the american academy of arts and sciences and the massachusetts historical society
the <unk> estate passed through several hands and was subdivided over time
the mansion was saved from demolition by the gore place society established for the purpose of preserving it which now operates it as a museum
it was declared a national historic landmark in <year>
nero was adopted by his grand @-@ uncle claudius to become his heir and successor and succeeded to the throne in <num> following claudius death
nero focused much of his attention on diplomacy trade and enhancing the cultural life of the empire but according to the historian <unk> he was viewed by the roman people as compulsive and corrupt
he ordered theatres built and promoted athletic games
during his reign the redoubtable general <unk> conducted a successful war and negotiated peace with the parthian empire
his general <unk> <unk> crushed a revolt in britain
nero annexed the <unk> kingdom to the empire and began the first jewish – roman war
in <num> ad most of rome was destroyed in the great fire of rome which many romans believed nero himself had started in order to clear land for his planned palatial complex the <unk> <unk>
in <num> the rebellion of <unk> in gaul and later the acclamation of <unk> in <unk> drove nero from the throne
facing a false report of being denounced as a public enemy who was to be executed he committed suicide on <num> june <num> the first roman emperor to do so
his death ended the julio @-@ <unk> dynasty sparking a brief period of civil wars known as the year of the four emperors
nero 's rule is often associated with tyranny and extravagance
he is known for many executions including that of his mother and the probable murder by poison of his <unk> <unk>
nero was rumored to have had captured christians dipped in oil and set on fire in his garden at night as a source of light
this view is based on the writings of <unk> <unk> and cassius <unk> the main surviving sources for nero 's reign but a few surviving sources paint nero in a more favourable light
some sources including some mentioned above portray him as an emperor who was popular with the common roman people especially in the east
some modern historians question the reliability of ancient sources when reporting on nero 's <unk> acts
he was the only son of gnaeus <unk> <unk> and <unk> the younger sister of emperor <unk>
nero 's father gnaeus was the son of lucius <unk> <unk> consul <num> bc and <unk> major
gnaeus was thus the grandson of gnaeus <unk> <unk> consul <num> bc and probably <unk> lepida on his father 's side and the grandson of mark antony and octavia minor on his mother 's side
thus nero had as his paternal grandmother <unk> major and also claimed more remote descent from <unk> minor as a great @-@ grandson — later grandson after claudius adopted him
through octavia nero was the great @-@ nephew of caesar augustus
nero 's father had been employed as a <unk> and was a member of <unk> 's staff when the latter travelled to the east some apparently think <unk> refers to augustus 's adopted son <unk> caesar here but this is not likely
nero 's father was described by <unk> as a murderer and a cheat who was charged by emperor <unk> with treason adultery and incest
<unk> died allowing him to escape these charges
nero 's father died of edema <unk> in <num> when nero was two
nero 's mother was <unk> the younger a great @-@ granddaughter of caesar augustus and his wife <unk> through their daughter julia the elder and her husband marcus <unk> <unk>
<unk> 's father <unk> was a grandson of augustus 's wife <unk> on one side and to mark antony and octavia on the other
<unk> mother <unk> minor was a daughter of octavia minor and mark antony
octavia was augustus elder sister
<unk> was also the adopted son of <unk>
<unk> poisoned her second husband <unk> crispus so many ancient historians also accuse her of murdering her third husband the emperor claudius
nero 's mother <unk> lost favour with <unk> and was exiled in <num> after her husband 's death
<unk> seized nero 's inheritance and sent him to be brought up by his less wealthy aunt <unk> lepida who was the mother of valeria <unk> claudius 's third wife
<unk> his wife <unk> and their infant daughter julia <unk> were murdered on <num> january <num>
these events led claudius <unk> 's uncle to become emperor
claudius allowed <unk> to return from exile
claudius had married twice before marrying valeria <unk>
his previous marriages produced three children including a son <unk> who died at a young age
he had two children with <unk> – claudia octavia born <num> and <unk> born <num>
<unk> was executed by claudius in the year <num>
in <num> ad claudius married a fourth time to nero 's mother <unk> despite her being his niece
to aid claudius politically young nero was adopted in <num> and took the name nero claudius caesar <unk> <unk> see adoption in rome
nero was older than his <unk> <unk> and thus became heir to the throne
nero was proclaimed an adult in <num> at the age of <num>
he was appointed <unk> entered and first addressed the senate made joint public appearances with claudius and was featured in coinage
in <num> he married his stepsister claudia octavia
though accounts vary many ancient historians state <unk> poisoned claudius
according to pliny the elder she used poison mushrooms
it is not known how much nero knew or if he was even involved in the death of claudius
<unk> wrote
for even if he was not the instigator of the emperor 's death he was at least privy to it as he openly admitted for he used afterwards to laud mushrooms the vehicle in which the poison was administered to claudius as the food of the gods as the greek proverb has it
at any rate after claudius death he vented on him every kind of insult in act and word charging him now with folly and now with cruelty for it was a favourite joke of his to say that claudius had ceased to play the fool among mortals <unk> the first syllable of the word <unk> and he disregarded many of his decrees and acts as the work of a madman and a <unk>
finally he neglected to enclose the place where his body was burned except with a low and mean wall
according to <unk> nero became emperor at the age of <num> when the news of claudius death was made known making him the youngest emperor at that time although what <unk> may have meant is that he was in his seventeenth year as his date of birth also listed by <unk> would have made him <num> at the time of claudius death
<unk> in book xiii of his annals describes nero as being scarcely out of his boyhood at the time he became emperor
ancient historians describe nero 's early reign as being strongly influenced by his mother <unk> his tutor lucius <unk> seneca and the praetorian prefect sextus <unk> <unk> especially in the first year
other tutors were less often mentioned such as alexander of <unk>
very early in nero 's rule problems arose from competition for influence between <unk> and nero 's two main advisers seneca and <unk>
<unk> also attempted to influence the young nero
<unk> also is mentioned by ancient sources as scheming for her son nero
this scheming continued as is evidenced by the coin of the both of them
it is extremely unusual to see a women 's face on a coin in the ancient world
it is because of this position of power <unk> felt jealous as seneca in particular rose up in nero 's court as he offered the advice nero wanted to hear unlike his mother
in <num> <unk> tried to sit down next to nero while he met with an armenian envoy but seneca stopped her and prevented a scandalous scene as it was unimaginable at that time for a woman to be in the same room as men doing official business
nero 's friends also mistrusted <unk> and told nero to beware of his mother
nero was reportedly unsatisfied with his marriage to octavia and entered into an affair with claudia <unk> a former slave
in <num> <unk> attempted to intervene in favor of octavia and demanded that her son dismiss <unk>
nero with the support of seneca resisted the intervention of his mother in his personal affairs
with <unk> 's influence over her son severed she reportedly began pushing for <unk> nero 's <unk> to become emperor
nearly fourteen @-@ year @-@ old <unk> heir @-@ designate prior to nero 's adoption was still legally a minor but was approaching legal adulthood
according to <unk> <unk> hoped that with her support <unk> being the blood son of claudius would be seen as the true heir to the throne by the state over nero
however the youth died suddenly and suspiciously on <num> february <num> the very day before his proclamation as an adult had been set
nero claimed that <unk> died from an epileptic seizure but ancient historians all claim <unk> death came from nero 's poisoning him
supposedly he enlisted the services of <unk> a woman who specialized in the manufacture of poisons
she devised a mixture to kill <unk> but after testing it unsuccessfully on a slave nero angrily threatened to have her put to death if she did not come up with something usable
<unk> then devised a new concoction that she promised would kill swifter than a viper
her promise was fulfilled after <unk> consumed it at a dinner party from water used to cool his wine which had already been tasted and succumbed within minutes
after the death of <unk> <unk> was accused of <unk> octavia and nero ordered her out of the imperial residence
in <num> he removed marcus antonius pallas an ally of <unk> from his position in the treasury
pallas along with <unk> was accused of conspiring against the emperor to bring <unk> sulla to the throne
seneca was accused of having relations with <unk> and embezzlement
seneca succeeded in having himself pallas and <unk> acquitted
according to cassius <unk> at this time seneca and <unk> reduced their role in governing from careful management to mere moderation of nero
in <num> nero became romantically involved with <unk> sabina the wife of his friend and future emperor otho
reportedly because a marriage to <unk> and a divorce from octavia did not seem politically feasible with <unk> alive nero ordered the murder of his mother in <num>
a number of modern historians find this an unlikely motive as nero did not marry <unk> until <num>
additionally according to <unk> <unk> did not divorce her husband until after <unk> 's death making it unlikely that the already married <unk> would be pressing nero for marriage
some modern historians theorize that nero 's execution of <unk> was prompted by her plotting to set <unk> <unk> on the throne
according to <unk> nero tried to kill his mother through a shipwreck planned by his freedman tutor <unk>
instead it took the life of <unk> 's friend <unk> <unk>
when <unk> survived he had her executed by <unk> and framed it as a suicide
the incident is also recorded by <unk>
in <num> nero 's adviser <unk> died
additionally seneca was again faced with embezzlement charges
seneca asked nero for permission to retire from public affairs
nero divorced and banished octavia on grounds of infertility leaving him free to marry the pregnant <unk>
after public protests nero was forced to allow octavia to return from exile but she was executed shortly after her return
nero also was reported to have kicked <unk> to death in <num> before she could have his second child
however modern historians noting <unk> <unk> and cassius <unk> 's possible bias against nero and the likelihood that they did not have eyewitness accounts of private events postulate that <unk> may have died because of complications of miscarriage or childbirth
accusations of treason being plotted against nero and the senate first appeared in <num>
the senate ruled that <unk> a <unk> should be put to death for speaking ill of nero at a party
later nero ordered the exile of fabricius <unk> who <unk> the senate in a book
<unk> writes that the roots of the conspiracy led by <unk> <unk> piso began in this year
to consolidate power nero executed a number of people in <num> and <num> including his rivals pallas <unk> <unk> and <unk> sulla
according to <unk> nero showed neither discrimination nor moderation in putting to death <unk> he pleased during this period
nero 's consolidation of power also included a slow usurping of authority from the senate
in <num> nero promised to give the senate powers equivalent to those under republican rule
by <num> senators complained that they had no power left and this led to the <unk> conspiracy
her body was not cremated it was stuffed with spices embalmed and put in the mausoleum of augustus
she was given a state funeral
nero praised her during the funeral eulogy and gave her divine honors
it is said that nero burned ten years worth of arabia 's incense production at her funeral
in the beginning of <num> he married <unk> <unk>
she was already married when she became nero 's mistress in <num> ad with <unk> 's husband being driven to suicide in <num> so nero could marry <unk>
she was one of the few of nero 's courtiers who survived the fall of his reign
in <num> nero ordered a young freedman <unk> to be <unk> and then married him
according to dion cassius <unk> bore an uncanny resemblance to sabina and nero even called him by his dead wife 's name
nero was criticized as being obsessed with personal popularity
nero began his reign in <num> by promising the senate more autonomy
in this first year he forbade others to refer to him with regard to <unk> for which he was praised by the senate
nero was known for spending his time visiting brothels and taverns during this period
in <num> nero began taking on a more active role as an administrator
he was consul four times between <num> and <num>
during this period some ancient historians speak fairly well of nero and contrast it with his later rule
under nero restrictions were put on the amount of bail and fines
also fees for lawyers were limited
there was a discussion in the senate on the misconduct of the freedmen class and a strong demand was made that patrons should have the right of <unk> freedom
nero supported the freedmen and ruled that patrons had no such right
the senate tried to pass a law in which the crimes of one slave applied to all slaves within a household
despite riots from the people nero supported the senate on their measure and deployed troops to organise the execution of <num> slaves affected by the law
however he vetoed strong measures against the freedmen affected by the case
after tax collectors were accused of being too harsh to the poor nero transferred collection authority to lower commissioners
nero banned any magistrate or procurator from exhibiting public entertainment for fear that the venue was being used as a method to sway the populace
additionally there were many <unk> and <unk> of government officials along with arrests for <unk> and corruption
when further complaints arose that the poor were being overly taxed nero attempted to repeal all indirect taxes
the senate convinced him this action would bankrupt the public treasury
as a compromise taxes were cut from <num>
<num> to <num>
<num>
additionally secret government tax records were ordered to become public
to lower the cost of food imports merchant ships were declared tax @-@ exempt
in imitation of the greeks nero built a number of <unk> and theatres
enormous gladiatorial shows were also held
nero also established the <unk> <unk>
the festival included games poetry and theater
historians indicate that there was a belief that theatre led to immorality
others considered that to have performers dressed in greek clothing was old fashioned
some questioned the large public expenditure on entertainment
in <num> rome burned
nero enacted a public relief effort as well as significant reconstruction
a number of other major construction projects occurred in nero 's late reign
nero had the marshes of <unk> filled with rubble from the fire
he erected the large <unk> <unk>
in <num> nero attempted to have a canal dug at the isthmus of <unk>
ancient historians state that these projects and others exacerbated the drain on the state 's budget
the cost to rebuild rome was immense requiring funds the state treasury did not have
nero <unk> the roman currency for the first time in the empire 's history
he reduced the weight of the <unk> from <num> per roman pound to <num> <num>
<num> grams to <num>
<num> grams
he also reduced the silver purity from <num>
<num> to <num>
<num> — the silver weight dropping from <num>
<num> grams to <num>
<num> grams
furthermore nero reduced the weight of the aureus from <num> per roman pound to <num> <num> grams to <num>
<num> grams
between <num> and <num> according to <unk> the elder and seneca nero promoted an expedition to discover the sources of the nile river
it was the first exploration of equatorial africa from europe in history
however nero 's expedition up the nile failed upon reaching the impenetrable <unk> of present @-@ day south sudan
the economic policy of nero is a point of debate among scholars
according to ancient historians nero 's construction projects were overly extravagant and the large number of expenditures under nero left italy thoroughly exhausted by contributions of money with the provinces ruined
modern historians though note that the period was riddled with <unk> and that it is likely that nero 's spending came in the form of public works projects and charity intended to ease economic troubles
the fire started at the southeastern end of the circus maximus in shops selling flammable goods
the extent of the fire is uncertain
according to <unk> who was nine at the time of the fire it spread quickly and burned for over five days
it destroyed three of fourteen roman districts and severely damaged seven
the only other historian who lived through the period and mentioned the fire is pliny the elder who wrote about it in passing
other historians who lived through the period including josephus <unk> <unk> plutarch and <unk> make no mention of it in what remains of their work
it is uncertain who or what actually caused the fire — whether accident or arson
<unk> and cassius <unk> favor nero as the arsonist so he could build a palatial complex
<unk> mentions that christians confessed to the crime but it is not known whether these confessions were induced by torture
however accidental fires were common in ancient rome
in fact rome suffered other large fires in <num> and in <num>
it was said by <unk> and cassius <unk> that nero sang the sack of ilium in stage costume while the city burned
popular legend claims that nero played the <unk> at the time of the fire an anachronism based merely on the concept of the lyre a <unk> instrument associated with nero and his performances
the <unk> was not invented until the <num> century
<unk> 's account however has nero in <unk> at the time of the fire
<unk> also said that nero playing his lyre and singing while the city burned was only rumor
according to <unk> upon hearing news of the fire nero returned to rome to organize a relief effort which he paid for from his own funds
nero 's contributions to the relief extended to personally taking part in the search for and rescue of victims of the blaze spending days searching the debris without even his bodyguards
after the fire nero opened his palaces to provide shelter for the homeless and arranged for food supplies to be delivered in order to prevent starvation among the survivors
in the wake of the fire he made a new urban development plan
houses after the fire were spaced out built in brick and faced by <unk> on wide roads
nero also built a new palace complex known as the <unk> <unk> in an area cleared by the fire
this included lush artificial landscapes and a <num> @-@ meter @-@ tall statue of himself the colossus of nero
the size of this complex is debated from <num> to <num> acres
to find the necessary funds for the reconstruction tributes were imposed on the provinces of the empire
<unk> in one of the earliest non @-@ christian references to the origins of christianity notes that the population searched for a scapegoat and rumors held nero responsible
to <unk> blame nero targeted christians
he ordered christians to be thrown to dogs while others were crucified and burned
he even composed songs that were performed by other entertainers throughout the empire
at first nero only performed for a private audience
in <num> ad
nero began singing in public in <unk> in order to improve his popularity
he also sang at the second <unk> <unk> in <num>
it was said that nero <unk> the attention but historians also write that nero was encouraged to sing and perform in public by the senate his inner circle and the people
ancient historians strongly criticize his choice to perform calling it shameful
nero was persuaded to participate in the olympic games of <num> in order to improve relations with greece and display roman dominance
as a competitor nero raced a ten @-@ horse chariot and nearly died after being thrown from it
he also performed as an actor and a singer
though nero faltered in his racing in one case dropping out entirely before the end and acting competitions he won these crowns nevertheless and paraded them when he returned to rome
the victories are attributed to nero bribing the judges and his status as emperor
this was seen as a parthian invasion of roman territory
there was concern in rome over how the young emperor would handle the situation
nero reacted by immediately sending the military to the region under the command of gnaeus <unk> <unk>
the parthians temporarily relinquished control of armenia to rome
the peace did not last and full @-@ scale war broke out in <num>
the parthian king <unk> i refused to remove his brother <unk> from armenia
the parthians began a full @-@ scale invasion of the armenian kingdom
commander <unk> responded and repelled most of the parthian army that same year
<unk> retreated and rome again controlled most of armenia
nero was acclaimed in public for this initial victory
<unk> a cappadocian noble raised in rome was installed by nero as the new ruler of armenia
<unk> was appointed governor of syria as a reward
in <num> <unk> invaded the parthian province of <unk>
again rome and <unk> were at war and this continued until <num>
<unk> began building up for a strike against the roman province of syria
<unk> tried to convince nero to continue the war but nero opted for a peace deal instead
there was anxiety in rome about eastern grain supplies and a budget deficit
the result was a deal where <unk> again became the armenian king but was crowned in rome by emperor nero
in the future the king of armenia was to be a parthian prince but his appointment required approval from the romans
<unk> was forced to come to rome and partake in ceremonies meant to display roman dominance
this peace deal of <num> was a considerable victory for nero politically
nero became very popular in the eastern provinces of rome and with the parthians as well
the peace between <unk> and rome lasted <num> years until emperor trajan of rome invaded armenia in <num>
like many emperors nero faced a number of rebellions and power struggles within the empire
british revolt of <num> – <num> boudica 's uprising in <num> a major rebellion broke out in the province of britannia
while the governor <unk> <unk> <unk> and his troops were busy capturing the island of mona anglesey from the druids the tribes of the southeast staged a revolt led by queen boudica of the <unk>
boudica and her troops destroyed three cities before the army of <unk> could return receive reinforcements and quell the rebellion in <num>
fearing <unk> himself would provoke further rebellion nero replaced him with the more passive <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> conspiracy of <num> in <num> <unk> <unk> piso a roman statesman organized a conspiracy against nero with the help of <unk> flavus and <unk> <unk> a tribune and a centurion of the praetorian guard
according to <unk> many conspirators wished to rescue the state from the emperor and restore the republic
the freedman <unk> discovered the conspiracy and reported it to nero 's secretary <unk>
as a result the conspiracy failed and its members were executed including <unk> the poet
nero 's previous advisor seneca was ordered to commit suicide after admitting he discussed the plot with the conspirators
the first jewish war of <num> – <num> in <num> there was a jewish revolt in judea stemming from greek and jewish religious tension
in <num> nero dispatched vespasian to restore order
this revolt was eventually put down in <num> after nero 's death
this revolt is famous for romans breaching the walls of jerusalem and destroying the second temple of jerusalem
lucius <unk> rufus the governor of <unk> superior was ordered to put down <unk> 's rebellion
in an attempt to gain support from outside his own province <unk> called upon <unk> <unk> <unk> the governor of <unk> <unk> to join the rebellion and further to declare himself emperor in opposition to nero
at the battle of <unk> in may <num> <unk> forces easily defeated those of <unk> and the latter committed suicide
however after putting down this one rebel <unk> <unk> attempted to proclaim their own commander as emperor
<unk> refused to act against nero but the discontent of the <unk> of germany and the continued opposition of <unk> in spain did not bode well for him
while nero had retained some control of the situation support for <unk> increased despite his being officially declared a public enemy
the prefect of the praetorian guard <unk> <unk> <unk> also abandoned his allegiance to the emperor and came out in support for <unk>
in response nero fled rome with the intention of going to the port of <unk> and from there to take a fleet to one of the still @-@ loyal eastern provinces
according to <unk> nero abandoned the idea when some army officers openly refused to obey his commands responding with a line from <unk> 's <unk> is it so dreadful a thing then to die nero then toyed with the idea of fleeing to <unk> throwing himself upon the mercy of <unk> or to appeal to the people and beg them to pardon him for his past offences and if he could not soften their hearts to <unk> them at least to allow him the prefecture of egypt
<unk> reports that the text of this speech was later found in nero 's writing desk but that he dared not give it from fear of being torn to pieces before he could reach the forum
nero returned to rome and spent the evening in the palace
after sleeping he awoke at about midnight to find the palace guard had left
dispatching messages to his friends palace chambers for them to come he received no answers
upon going to their chambers personally he found them all abandoned
when he called for a gladiator or anyone else adept with a sword to kill him no one appeared
he cried have i neither friend nor foe and ran out as if to throw himself into the tiber
returning nero sought for some place where he could hide and collect his thoughts
an imperial freedman <unk> offered his villa located <num> miles outside the city
travelling in disguise nero and four loyal freedmen <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> reached the villa where nero ordered them to dig a grave for him
at this time a courier arrived with a report that the senate had declared nero a public enemy and that it was their intention to execute him by beating him to death and that armed men had been sent to apprehend him for the act to take place in the forum
the senate actually was still reluctant and <unk> on the right course of action as nero was the last member of the julio @-@ <unk> family
indeed most of the senators had served the imperial family all their lives and felt a sense of loyalty to the deified bloodline if not to nero himself
the men actually had the goal of returning nero back to the senate where the senate hoped to work out a compromise with the rebelling governors that would preserve nero 's life so that at least a future heir to the dynasty could be produced
nero however did not know this and at the news brought by the courier he prepared himself for suicide pacing up and down <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which translates to english as what an artist dies in me
losing his nerve he first begged for one of his companions to set an example by first killing himself
at last the sound of approaching horsemen drove nero to face the end
however he still could not bring himself to take his own life but instead he forced his private secretary <unk> to perform the task
when one of the horsemen entered upon his seeing nero all but dead he attempted to stop the bleeding in vain
nero 's final words were too late this is fidelity he died on <num> june <num> the anniversary of the death of octavia and was buried in the mausoleum of the <unk> <unk> in what is now the villa borghese <unk> hill area of rome
with his death the julio @-@ <unk> dynasty ended
the senate when news of his death reached rome posthumously declared nero a public enemy to appease the coming <unk> as the senate had initially declared <unk> as a public enemy and proclaimed <unk> the new emperor
chaos would ensue in the year of the four emperors
<unk> though describes a more complicated political environment
<unk> mentions that nero 's death was welcomed by senators nobility and the upper class
the lower @-@ class slaves <unk> of the arena and the theater and those who were supported by the famous excesses of nero on the other hand were upset with the news
members of the military were said to have mixed feelings as they had allegiance to nero but were <unk> to overthrow him
eastern sources namely <unk> ii and <unk> of <unk> mention that nero 's death was <unk> as he restored the liberties of <unk> with a wisdom and moderation quite alien to his character and that he held our liberties in his hand and respected them
modern scholarship generally holds that while the senate and more well @-@ off individuals welcomed nero 's death the general populace was loyal to the end and beyond for otho and <unk> both thought it worthwhile to appeal to their nostalgia
nero 's name was erased from some monuments in what edward <unk> regards as an outburst of private zeal
many portraits of nero were reworked to represent other figures according to eric r
<unk> over fifty such images survive
this reworking of images is often explained as part of the way in which the memory of disgraced emperors was condemned posthumously see <unk> <unk>
<unk> however doubts that the practice is necessarily negative and notes that some continued to create images of nero long after his death
the civil war during the year of the four emperors was described by ancient historians as a troubling period
according to <unk> this instability was rooted in the fact that emperors could no longer rely on the perceived legitimacy of the imperial bloodline as nero and those before him could
<unk> began his short reign with the execution of many allies of nero and possible future enemies
one such notable enemy included <unk> <unk> who claimed to be the son of emperor <unk>
otho overthrew <unk>
otho was said to be liked by many soldiers because he had been a friend of nero 's and resembled him somewhat in temperament
it was said that the common roman hailed otho as nero himself
otho used nero as a surname and <unk> many statues to nero
<unk> overthrew otho
<unk> began his reign with a large funeral for nero complete with songs written by nero
after nero 's suicide in <num> there was a widespread belief especially in the eastern provinces that he was not dead and somehow would return
this belief came to be known as the nero <unk> legend
the legend of nero 's return lasted for hundreds of years after nero 's death
augustine of hippo wrote of the legend as a popular belief in <num>
at least three nero <unk> emerged leading rebellions
the first who sang and played the cithara or lyre and whose face was similar to that of the dead emperor appeared in <num> during the reign of <unk>
after persuading some to recognize him he was captured and executed
sometime during the reign of titus <num> – <num> another <unk> appeared in asia and sang to the accompaniment of the lyre and looked like nero but he too was killed
twenty years after nero 's death during the reign of <unk> there was a third <unk>
he was supported by the parthians who only reluctantly gave him up and the matter almost came to war
these first histories at one time did exist and were described as biased and fantastical either overly critical or praising of nero
the original sources were also said to contradict on a number of events
nonetheless these lost primary sources were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on nero written by the next generations of historians
a few of the contemporary historians are known by name
fabius <unk> <unk> rufus and pliny the elder all wrote condemning histories on nero that are now lost
there were also pro @-@ nero histories but it is unknown who wrote them or for what deeds nero was praised
the bulk of what is known of nero comes from <unk> <unk> and cassius <unk> who were all of the senatorial class
<unk> and <unk> wrote their histories on nero over fifty years after his death while cassius <unk> wrote his history over <num> years after nero 's death
these sources contradict on a number of events in nero 's life including the death of claudius the death of <unk> and the roman fire of <num> but they are consistent in their condemnation of nero
a handful of other sources also add a limited and varying perspective on nero
few surviving sources paint nero in a favourable light
some sources though portray him as a competent emperor who was popular with the roman people especially in the east
cassius <unk> cassius <unk> c
<num> – <num> was the son of cassius <unk> a roman senator
he passed the greater part of his life in public service
he was a senator under <unk> and governor of <unk> after the death of septimius severus and afterwards <unk> consul around <num> and also <unk> in africa and <unk>
books <num> – <num> of <unk> 's roman history describe the reign of nero
only fragments of these books remain and what does remain was abridged and altered by john <unk> an <num> @-@ century monk
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> c
<num> – <num> a greek philosopher and historian wrote the roman people were very happy with nero and would have allowed him to rule indefinitely
they <unk> for his rule once he was gone and embraced <unk> when they appeared indeed the truth about this has not come out even yet for so far as the rest of his subjects were concerned there was nothing to prevent his continuing to be emperor for all time seeing that even now everybody wishes he were still alive
and the great majority do believe that he still is although in a certain sense he has died not once but often along with those who had been firmly convinced that he was still alive
<unk> <unk> c
<num> – <num> was the slave to nero 's scribe <unk>
he makes a few passing negative comments on nero 's character in his work but makes no remarks on the nature of his rule
he describes nero as a spoiled angry and unhappy man
josephus the historian josephus c
<num> – <num> while calling nero a tyrant was also the first to mention bias against nero
of other historians he said but i omit any further discourse about these affairs for there have been a great many who have composed the history of nero some of which have departed from the truth of facts out of favour as having received benefits from him while others out of hatred to him and the great ill @-@ will which they bore him have so <unk> raved against him with their lies that they justly deserve to be condemned
nor do i wonder at such as have told lies of nero since they have not in their writings preserved the truth of history as to those facts that were earlier than his time even when the actors could have no way incurred their hatred since those writers lived a long time after them
<unk> though more of a poet than historian <unk> c
<num> – <num> has one of the kindest accounts of nero 's rule
he writes of peace and prosperity under nero in contrast to previous war and strife
ironically he was later involved in a conspiracy to overthrow nero and was executed
<unk> <unk> ii the <unk> c
<num> – <num> spoke of nero in the life of <unk> <unk> books <num> – <num>
though he has a generally bad or dim view of nero he speaks of others positive reception of nero in the east
pliny the elder the history of nero by pliny the elder c
<num> – <num> did not survive
still there are several references to nero in pliny 's natural histories
pliny has one of the worst opinions of nero and calls him an enemy of mankind
plutarch plutarch c
<num> – <num> mentions nero indirectly in his account of the life of <unk> and the life of otho
nero is portrayed as a tyrant but those that replace him are not described as better
seneca the younger it is not surprising that seneca c
<num> bc – <num> nero 's teacher and advisor writes very well of nero
<unk> <unk> c
<num> – <num> was a member of the equestrian order and he was the head of the department of the imperial correspondence
while in this position <unk> started writing biographies of the emperors <unk> the anecdotal and sensational aspects
<unk> the annals by <unk> c
<num> – <num> is the most detailed and comprehensive history on the rule of nero despite being incomplete after the year <num>
<unk> described the rule of the julio @-@ <unk> emperors as generally unjust
he also thought that existing writing on them was unbalanced the histories of <unk> <unk> claudius and nero while they were in power were falsified through terror and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred
<unk> was the son of a procurator who married into the elite family of agricola
he entered his political life as a senator after nero 's death and by <unk> own admission owed much to nero 's rivals
realising that this bias may be apparent to others <unk> protests that his writing is true
girolamo <unk> in <year> girolamo <unk> published in basel his <unk> <unk> which was one of the first historical references of the modern era to portray nero in a positive light
according to the talmud nero went to jerusalem and shot arrows in all four directions
all the arrows landed in the city
he then asked a passing child to repeat the verse he had learned that day
the child responded i will lay my vengeance upon <unk> by the hand of my people israel <unk>
<num> @,@ <num>
nero became terrified believing that god wanted the temple in jerusalem to be destroyed but would punish the one to carry it out
nero said he desires to lay waste his house and to lay the blame on me whereupon he fled and converted to judaism to avoid such retribution
vespasian was then dispatched to put down the rebellion
the talmud adds that the sage <unk> meir baal <unk> rabbi meir or rabbi meir baal hanes rabbi meir the miracle maker was a jewish sage who lived in the time of the <unk> a prominent supporter of the bar <unk> rebellion against roman rule
he was considered one of the greatest of the <unk> of the third generation <num> @-@ <num>
according to the talmud his father was a descendant of the roman emperor nero who had converted to judaism
his wife <unk> is one of the few women cited in the <unk>
he is the third most frequently mentioned sage in the mishnah
roman and greek sources nowhere report nero 's alleged trip to jerusalem or his alleged conversion to judaism
there is also no record of nero having any offspring who survived infancy his only recorded child claudia augusta died aged <num> months
<unk> also mentions nero punishing christians though he does so because they are given to a new and mischievous superstition and does not connect it with the fire
christian writer tertullian c
<num> – <num> was the first to call nero the first <unk> of christians
he wrote examine your records
there you will find that nero was the first that persecuted this doctrine
<unk> c
<num> – <num> also said that nero first persecuted the servants of god
as does <unk> severus
however <unk> writes that since the jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of <unk> he emperor claudius expelled them from rome <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> roma <unk>
these expelled jews may have been early christians although <unk> is not explicit
nor is the bible explicit calling aquila of pontus and his wife priscilla both expelled from italy at the time jews
d
the apocryphal ascension of isaiah a christian writing from the <num> century says the slayer of his mother who himself even this king will <unk> the plant which the twelve apostles of the beloved have planted
of the twelve one will be delivered into his hands was interpreted to mean nero
bishop eusebius of caesarea c
<num> – <num> was the first to write explicitly that paul was beheaded in rome during the reign of nero
he states that nero 's persecution led to peter and paul 's deaths but that nero did not give any specific orders
however several other accounts going back to the 1st century have paul surviving his two years in rome and travelling to <unk> before facing trial in rome again prior to his death
peter is first said to have been crucified upside @-@ down in rome during nero 's reign but not by nero in the apocryphal acts of peter c
<num>
the account ends with paul still alive and nero abiding by god 's command not to <unk> any more christians
by the <num> century a number of writers were stating that nero killed peter and paul
within christian communities these writings along with others fueled the belief that nero would return as the <unk>
in <num> <unk> wrote that nero suddenly disappeared and even the burial place of that noxious wild beast was nowhere to be seen
this has led some persons of extravagant imagination to suppose that having been conveyed to a distant region he is still reserved alive and to him they apply the sibylline verses <unk> maintains that it is not right to believe this
in <num> augustine of hippo wrote about <num> <unk> <num> <num> – <num> where he believed paul mentioned the coming of the <unk>
though he rejects the theory augustine mentions that many christians believed that nero was the <unk> or would return as the <unk>
he wrote so that in saying for the mystery of iniquity doth already work he alluded to nero whose deeds already seemed to be as the deeds of <unk>
some modern biblical scholars such as <unk> <unk> johns hopkins university of the american schools of oriental research and the editors of the oxford harper collins study bibles contend that the number <num> in the book of revelation is a code for nero a view that is also supported in roman catholic biblical commentaries

this <unk> leaved non @-@ spiny genus includes both small palms lacking an aboveground stem and large trees
the genus has a complicated taxonomic history and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers
since the genera can only be distinguished on the basis of their male flowers the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping them all in the same genus
this has been supported by a recent molecular phylogeny
somewhere between <num> and <num> species are recognised in the genus with estimates of as many as <num>
incomplete <unk> collections make it difficult to determine whether certain groups represent single species or groups of similar species
<unk> species have a long history of human use and include economically important sources of palm oil and fibre
many species are fire tolerant and thrive in disturbed habitats
their seeds are animal dispersed including some which are thought to have been adapted for dispersal by now @-@ extinct pleistocene <unk>
species are also non @-@ spiny palms and includes both large trees with stout stems up to <num> metres <num> ft tall and <unk> palms one which lack an aboveground stem
the number of leaves per individual varies from about three to thirty @-@ five larger plants tend to have more and longer leaves
inflorescences are large branched and borne among the leaves
the inflorescence consists of a main axis — the <unk> and the <unk> — and a series of smaller branches the <unk>
the <unk> which bear the flowers emerge from the <unk>
the <unk> is the main stalk connecting the <unk> with the stem
inflorescences either consist entirely of male flowers or are predominantly female with a few male flowers
fruit usually have two or three seeds although fewer or more are present in some species and are usually brown yellow orange @-@ brown or purple when mature
four different types of male flowers exist
on the basis of these flower types the genus has often been split into four genera — a more narrowly defined <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
the species sometimes referred to <unk> have coiled <unk> while the other groups have straight ones
the <unk> of those placed in <unk> are much shorter than the <unk> while those placed in <unk> and a more narrowly defined <unk> have <unk> that are longer than the <unk>
five species do not fit easily into any of these groups this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus
within this subtribe <unk> has been found to be a monophyletic group and sister to the clade containing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
disagreement exists as to whether <unk> should be considered a single genus or a group of related genera
in their <year> field guide to the palms of the americas andrew henderson gloria <unk> and <unk> bernal combined all the species in the subtribe <unk> as it was then defined into a single genus <unk>
in his <year> taxonomic treatment of palm subtribe <unk> american botanist sidney f
<unk> divided the group into five genera — a more narrowly defined <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and john <unk> recognised a single genus in their <year> world checklist of palms and jean @-@ christophe <unk> continued this usage in his <year> review of the genus
the multi @-@ genus approach is based solely on the structure of the male flowers no other characters could be consistently associated with one genus or another
four of the genera — <unk> in a narrow sense <unk> <unk> and <unk> — correspond to four different types of male flowers found within the genus
however a few species have flowers that are intermediate between these four types including a
<unk> which <unk> placed in its own genus <unk> and this has been used as an argument for the single @-@ genus approach
in addition there are several hybrids between species that would be considered different genera under <unk> 's five @-@ genus system which has also been used as an argument for placing them in a single genus
in <year> alan <unk> and colleagues published a molecular phylogeny of the subtribe which found that some species placed in <unk> were actually more closely related to species placed in <unk> than they were to other members of that genus if the five @-@ genus approach was used while a
<unk> placed in <unk> by <unk> was actually a sister to both <unk> and <unk>
<unk>
the genus was named for <unk> iii <unk> king of <unk> known for his interest in medicinal plants
the type species is a
<unk> a colombian endemic
the genera <unk> and <unk> were described by carl friedrich philipp von <unk> in <year> and <year> respectively
<unk> was described by hermann <unk> in <year> and <unk> by orator f
cook in <year>
in <year> dutch taxonomist jan gerard <unk> boer estimated that there may be as many as <num> species in the genus
in their <year> field guide to the palms of the americas andrew henderson and <unk> recognised <num> species in the genus while sidney <unk> recognised <num> species in his <year> treatment of the group
largely following <unk> 's lead <unk> <unk> and john <unk> recognised <num> species in their <year> world checklist of palms
an important element of this disagreement is the decision by <unk> to define species more narrowly than henderson
as a result what henderson interpreted as variation within species <unk> took as differences between morphologically similar species
this problem is complicated by the fact that many of these species are poorly represented in <unk> collections
the large size of the leaves inflorescences and fruit of many <unk> species makes them difficult to collect
in addition many important collections including type specimen have been lost or destroyed
sparse or incomplete collections make it difficult to differentiate variation within a single species from variation between different species
the three recent treatments henderson and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> recognised a total of <num> species but only <num> species are accepted by all of them
the remainder account for either nine species or more than <num>
for example what andrew henderson considered a single species <unk> <unk> other authors have considered a species complex consisting of four or five species
<unk> doubted the validity of a
<unk> as a species and described four new species from material that had previously been attributed to a
<unk> — a
<unk> a
<unk> a
<unk> and a
<unk>
<unk> and <unk> accepted both <unk> 's four species and a
<unk>
however jean @-@ christophe <unk> was of the opinion that a
<unk> a
<unk> and a
<unk> were all very similar and thought it likely that they all represented the same species
another species complex in <unk> includes a
<unk> and related species
henderson <year> recognised a
<unk> and a
<unk> considering the latter to either be an <unk> form of a
<unk> or a hybrid between it and a
<unk>
<unk> and <unk> accepted a
<unk> but <unk> considered it a dubious taxon
<unk> <unk> was recognised as a distinct species by michael <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> concurred but henderson considered it part of a
<unk>
<unk> also described a fourth member of this group a
<unk> and it is accepted by <unk> and <unk>
various species have been described as being insect @-@ <unk> including a
<unk> while pollination in a
<unk> and a
<unk> has been attributed both to insects and wind
seed germination is remote tubular — during germination as the cotyledon expands it pushes the young shoot away from the seed
after germination the stem initially grows downward before turning to grow upward and produce the aboveground stem
this produces a saxophone shaped <unk> portion of the stem
the fact that the shoot tips of <unk> seedlings are underground it likely to contribute to their fire @-@ tolerance
according to <unk> and <unk> three species are found in mexico four in central america and <num> in south america
three species are present in the caribbean — two in trinidad and tobago along the southern edge of the region and one in haiti
dense stands of some of the larger species are conspicuous elements on the landscape while smaller species are found in both in the forest <unk> and in <unk>
disturbance has been implicated in the formation of vegetation dominated by large <unk> species
in seasonally dry amazonian forests the density of large adult a
<unk> palms was correlated with canopy <unk> the species also dominates <unk> formed by repeated forest fires in trinidad and tobago
<unk> <unk> forms pure stands in many parts of brazil where natural forest vegetation has been cleared
similarly stands of a
<unk> in bahia brazil which are cultivated for piassava fibre are managed using fire — the seedlings survive cutting and burning and are able to dominate burned forest patches
the fruit are dispersed by animals fruit which are not dispersed frequently suffer seed predation by <unk> beetles
certain species of <unk> have been mentioned as examples of anachronistic species which are adapted for dispersal by now @-@ extinct pleistocene <unk>
on <unk> island <unk> in the brazilian amazon <unk> <unk> fruit were consumed by <unk> <unk> <unk> deer and primates
rodents including <unk> fed upon the fruit and as the fruit availability declined they fed on the seeds
other <unk> of <unk> fruit include crested <unk> which consume the fruit and disperse the seeds of a

numerous factors would play into the winding down and eventual closing of the thanhouser film corporation with much advance notice by edwin thanhouser
q
david bowers writes that it was easy to understand thanhouser 's decision to retire due to numerous aspects including that releases through <unk> were based on their decision to release or discard the work the new rochelle studio was <num> @,@ <num> miles from the center of the trade activity and the slump in industry tied to world war i
weeks before the film was released variety told of the winding down of the thanhouser with the studio 's staff consisting of edwin thanhouser and the bookkeeper <unk> b
bishop
the article concluded with the announcement that lloyd f
lonergan the scenario writer of the company had retired from the company
as it wound down the thanhouser company was announced to have no liabilities would close with a positive bank balance
little is known of the production of this final film but it was directed by emile <unk> from a scenario written by lloyd f
lonergan
the cameraman was jacques <unk>
charles e
wagner of the <unk> 's trade review found it to be a good film with great direction and photography but was concerned that the stunt in which the baby appeared to be involved in the accident was too real
wagner stated the film had sufficient action and pathos without sexual <unk> which should prove a strong program for the <unk> program
frances agnew of the morning telegraph found it to be an average picture that was not exceptional for audiences but it would hold sentimental appeal for the average viewer
a reviewer for the the new york dramatic mirror found the film 's excessive use of coincidental meetings to be highly improbable but found <unk> 's performance to be excellent and the rest of the cast give good performances
the reviewer said that emile <unk> had made the improbable story more plausible
like many american films of the time the heart of ezra greer was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards
the chicago board of censors required the cutting in reel <num> of a letter stating i cannot face my father etc
and two <unk> of gambling scenes and in reel <num> a change of the <unk> because it means her whole future to because she is his wife
its name was taken from a sign painted on a gable wall in the <unk> in january <year> which read you are now entering free derry
the area which included the <unk> and <unk> neighbourhoods was secured by community activists for the first time on <num> january <year> following an incursion into the <unk> by members of the royal ulster constabulary <unk>
residents built barricades and carried clubs and similar arms to prevent the <unk> from entering
after six days the residents took down the barricades and <unk> patrols resumed but tensions remained high over the following months
violence reached a peak on <num> august <year> culminating in the battle of the <unk> — a three @-@ day pitched battle between residents and the <unk>
on <num> august units of the british army were deployed at the edge of the <unk> and the <unk> were withdrawn
the derry citizens defence association <unk> declared their intention to hold the area against both the <unk> and the british army until their demands were met
the british army made no attempt to enter the area
the situation continued until october <year> when following publication of the hunt report military police were allowed in
the irish republican army ira began to re @-@ arm and recruit after august <year>
in december <year> it split into the official ira and the provisional ira
both were supported by the people of the free derry area
meanwhile relations between the british army and the nationalist community which were initially good deteriorated
in july <year> there was a surge of recruitment into the ira after two young men were shot and killed by british troops
the government introduced internment on <num> august <year> and in response barricades went up once more in the <unk> and <unk>
this time free derry was a no @-@ go area defended by armed members of both the official and provisional ira
from within the area they launched attacks on the british army and the <unk> began a bombing campaign in the city centre
as before unarmed auxiliaries manned the barricades and crime was dealt with by a voluntary body known as the free derry police
support for the ira increased further after bloody sunday in january <year> when thirteen unarmed men and boys were shot dead by the british army 's parachute regiment at a march in the <unk> a <num> man was wounded and died <num> <num> months later
the support began to <unk> after the killing by the official ira of a local youth who was home on leave from the british army
after a provisional ira ceasefire during which it entered talks with the british government broke down the british took the decision to move against the no @-@ go areas
free derry came to an end on <num> july <year> when thousands of british troops moved in with armoured cars and bulldozers to occupy the area
it has a majority nationalist population and nationalists won a majority of seats in the <year> local elections
despite this the ulster unionist party controlled the local council londonderry corporation from <year> onwards
the unionists maintained their majority firstly by manipulating the constituency boundaries gerrymandering so that the south ward with a nationalist majority returned eight councillors while the much smaller north ward and waterside ward with unionist majorities returned twelve councillors between them secondly by allowing only <unk> to vote in local elections rather than one man one vote so that a higher number of nationalists who did not own homes were disenfranchised and <unk> by denying houses to nationalists outside the south ward constituency
the result was that there were about <num> @,@ <num> nationalist families and practically no unionists on the housing waiting list and that housing in the nationalist area was crowded and of a very poor condition
the south ward comprised the <unk> <unk> <unk> bishop street and foyle road and it was this area that would become free derry
the derry housing action committee <unk> was formed in march <year> by members of the derry branch of the northern ireland labour party and the james connolly republican club including eamonn mccann and <unk> <unk>
it disrupted a meeting of londonderry corporation in march <year> and in may blocked traffic by placing a caravan that was home to a family of four in the middle of the <unk> road in the <unk> and staging a sit @-@ down protest at the opening of the second deck of the <unk> bridge
after the meeting of londonderry corporation was again disrupted in august <unk> <unk> telephoned the northern ireland civil rights association <unk> and invited them to hold a march in derry
the date chosen was <num> october <year> an <unk> committee was formed although in reality most of the organizing was done by mccann and <unk> and the route was to take the marchers inside the city walls where nationalists were traditionally not permitted to march
the minister of home affairs william craig made an order on <num> october prohibiting the march on the grounds that the apprentice boys of derry were intending to hold a march on the same day
in the words of martin <unk> of cain this particular tactic
provided the excuse needed to ban the march
when the marchers attempted to defy the ban on <num> october they were stopped by a royal ulster constabulary <unk> cordon
the police drew their batons and struck marchers including stormont mp eddie mcateer and westminster mp gerry <unk>
subsequently the police broke ranks and used their batons indiscriminately on people in duke street
marchers trying to escape met another party of police and these police also used their batons indiscriminately
water cannons were also used
the police action caused outrage in the nationalist area of derry and at a meeting four days later the derry citizens action committee <unk> was formed with john hume as chairman and ivan cooper as vice @-@ chairman
they organised a march from belfast to derry in support of civil rights starting out with about forty young people on <num> january <year>
the march met with violent opposition from loyalist counter @-@ demonstrators at several points along the route
finally at <unk> bridge five miles outside derry they were attacked by a mob of about two hundred wielding clubs — some of them studded with nails — and stones
half of the attackers were later identified from press photographs as members of the b @-@ specials
the police who were at the scene <unk> to the b @-@ specials as they prepared their ambush and then failed to protect the marchers many of whom ran into the river and were <unk> with stones from the bank
dozens of marchers were taken to hospital
the remainder continued on to derry where they were attacked once more on their way to <unk> bridge before they finally reached guildhall square where they held a rally
rioting broke out after the rally
police drove <unk> into the <unk> but did not come after them
in the early hours of the following morning <num> january members of the <unk> charged into st
<unk> 's wells and <unk> road in the <unk> breaking windows and beating residents
in his report on the disturbances lord cameron remarked that for such conduct among members of a disciplined and well @-@ led force there can be no acceptable justification or excuse and added that its effect in <unk> passions and inspiring hostility towards the police was <unk> great
that afternoon over <num> @,@ <num> <unk> residents built barricades armed themselves with steel bars wooden clubs and <unk> and told the police that they would not be allowed into the area
<unk> chairman john hume told a meeting of residents that they were to defend the area and no @-@ one was to come in
groups of men wearing <unk> patrolled the streets in shifts
john <unk> casey a local activist painted you are now entering free derry in white paint on the gable wall of a house on the corner of <unk> road and <unk> street
that corner which was a popular venue for meetings later became known as free derry corner
on <num> january the <unk> area was extended to include the <unk> another nationalist area on a hill overlooking the <unk>
a clandestine radio station calling itself radio free derry began broadcasting to residents playing rebel songs and encouraging resistance
on a small number of occasions law @-@ breakers attempted crimes but were dealt with by the patrols
despite all this the irish times reported that the infrastructure of revolutionary control in the area has not been developed beyond the maintenance of patrols
following some acts of destruction and of violence late in the week members of the <unk> including ivan cooper addressed residents on friday <num> january and called on them to dismantle the barricades
the barricades were taken down the following morning
violence came to a head on saturday <num> april after a planned march from <unk> bridge to the city centre was banned
a protest in the city centre led to clashes with <unk> — unionists in sympathy with the anti @-@ civil rights stance of ian paisley
police attempting to drive the protesters back into the <unk> were themselves driven back to their barracks
a series of pitched battles followed and barricades were built often under the supervision of bernadette devlin newly elected mp for mid ulster
police pursuing <unk> broke into a house in william street and severely beat the occupant samuel <unk> his family and two friends
<unk> was brought to hospital bleeding <unk> from a number of head wounds
at midnight four hundred <unk> men in full riot gear and carrying riot shields occupied the <unk>
convoys of police vehicles drove through the area with headlights blazing
the following day several thousand residents led by the <unk> withdrew to the <unk> and issued an ultimatum to the <unk> — withdraw within two hours or be driven out
with fifteen minutes of the two hours remaining the police marched out through the <unk> 's gate even as the residents were entering from the far side
the barricades were not maintained on this occasion and routine patrols were not prevented
samuel <unk> suffered a heart attack four days after his beating
on <num> july he suffered a further heart attack and died
thousands attended his funeral and the mood was sufficiently angry that it was clear the annual apprentice boys parade scheduled for <num> august could not take place without causing serious disturbance
at that time the parade was held on <num> august each year
participants from across northern ireland and britain marched along the city walls above the <unk> and were often openly hostile to the residents
on <num> july <year> the derry citizens defence association <unk> was formed to try to preserve peace during the period of the parade and to defend the <unk> and <unk> in the event of an attack
the chairman was seán keenan an irish republican army ira veteran the vice @-@ chairman was paddy doherty a popular local man sometimes known as paddy <unk> and the secretary was johnnie white another leading republican and leader of the james connolly republican club
street committees were formed under the overall command of the <unk> and barricades were built on the night of <num> august
the parade took place as planned on <num> august
as it passed through waterloo place on the edge of the <unk> hostilities began between supporters and opponents of the parade
fighting between the two groups continued for two hours then the police joined in
they charged up william street against the <unk> followed by the <unk>
they were met with a hail of stones and petrol bombs
the ensuing battle became known as the battle of the <unk>
late in the evening having been driven back repeatedly the police fired canisters of <unk> gas into the crowd
youths on the roof of a high @-@ rise block of flats on <unk> street threw petrol bombs down on the police
<unk> @-@ <unk> were used to maintain contact between different areas of fighting and <unk> headquarters in paddy doherty 's house in westland street and first aid stations were operating staffed by doctors nurses and volunteers
women and girls made milk @-@ bottle <unk> of petrol bombs for supply to the youths in the front line and radio free derry broadcast to the fighters and their families
on the third day of fighting <num> august the northern ireland government mobilised the ulster special constabulary b @-@ specials a force greatly feared by nationalists in derry and elsewhere
before they engaged however british troops were deployed at the scene carrying automatic rifles and sub @-@ machine guns
the <unk> and b @-@ specials withdrew and the troops took up positions outside the <unk> area
a deputation that included eamonn mccann met senior army officers and told them that the army would not be allowed in until certain demands were met including the <unk> of the <unk> the disbandment of the b @-@ specials and the abolition of stormont the parliament and government of northern ireland
the officers agreed that neither troops nor police would enter the <unk> and <unk> districts
a peace corps was formed to maintain law and order
when the british home secretary jim <unk> visited northern ireland and announced his intention to visit the <unk> on <num> august he was told that he would not be allowed to bring either police or soldiers with him
<unk> agreed
accompanied by members of the defence committee he was swept along by a surging crowd of thousands up <unk> street and into <unk> road where he took refuge in a local house and later addressed crowds from an upstairs window
in preparation for <unk> 's visit the free derry wall was painted white and the you are now entering free derry sign was professionally re @-@ painted in black lettering
following <unk> 's visit some barricades were breached but the majority remained while the people awaited concrete evidence of reform
still the army made no move to enter the area
law and order was maintained by a peace corps — volunteers organised by the <unk> to patrol the streets and man the barricades
there was very little crime
punishment in the words of eamonn mccann as often as not consisted of a stern lecture from seán keenan on the need for solidarity within the area
in september the barricades were replaced with a white line painted on the road
the hunt report on the future of policing in northern ireland was presented to the stormont cabinet in early october
jim <unk> held talks with the cabinet in belfast on <num> october following which the report 's recommendations were accepted and made public
they included the recommendation that the <unk> should be ordinarily unarmed and that the b @-@ specials should be phased out and replaced by a new force
the new <unk> chief constable arthur young an englishman was announced and travelled to belfast with <unk>
the same day seán keenan announced that the <unk> was to be dissolved
on <num> october <unk> and young visited free derry and on <num> october the first military police entered the <unk> on foot and unarmed
it was low in both personnel and equipment — chief of staff cathal <unk> told seán keenan and paddy doherty in august <year> that he couldn 't defend the <unk>
i haven 't the men nor the guns to do it
during the <num> the leadership of the republican movement had moved to the left
its focus was on class struggle and its aim was to unite the irish nationalist and unionist working classes in order to overthrow capitalism both british and irish
republican clubs were formed in northern ireland where sinn féin was proscribed
these clubs were involved in the formation of <unk> in <year>
in derry the james connolly republican club worked closely with labour party radicals with whom they set up the derry housing action committee and derry unemployed action committee
the derry citizens defence association was formed initially by republicans who then invited other nationalists to join
although there were tensions between the younger leaders like johnnie white and the older traditional republicans such as seán keenan both sides saw the unrest of <year> @-@ <num> as a chance to advance republican aims and the two shared the platform at the easter rising commemoration in april <year>
the events of august <year> in derry and more particularly in belfast where the ira was unable to prevent loss of life or protect families burned out of their homes brought to a head the divisions that had already appeared within the movement between the radicals and the traditionalists and led to a split in december <year> into the official ira and the provisional ira
initially both armies organised for defensive purposes only although the <unk> were planning towards an offensive campaign
in derry there was far less hostility between the two organisations than elsewhere and <unk> commonly paid subscriptions to both
when <unk> were arrested after the official 's easter parade in march <year> officials and <unk> <unk> their trial together
at the start the officials attracted most of the younger members
martin mcguinness who in august <year> had helped defend the barricades initially joined the officials but a few months later left to join the <unk>
relations between the british army and the residents had steadily decayed since the first appearance of troops in august <year>
in september after clashes between nationalist and unionist crowds that led to the death of a protestant man william king the british army erected a peace ring to enclose the nationalist population in the area they had previously controlled
roads into the city centre were closed at night and people were prevented from walking on certain streets
although some moderate nationalists accepted this as necessary there was anger among young people
clashes between youths and troops became more frequent
the riot following the officials easter parade in march <year> marked the first time that the army used snatch squads who rushed into the <unk> wielding batons to make arrests
the snatch squads soon became a common feature of army arrest operations
there was also a belief that they were arresting people at random sometimes days after the alleged offence and based on the identification of people that they had seen from a considerable distance
the <unk> were condemned as hooligans by moderates who saw the riots as hampering attempts to resolve the situation
the labour radicals and official republicans still working together tried to turn the youth away from rioting and create socialist organizations — one such organization was named the young hooligans association — but to no <unk>
the <unk> while <unk> of riots viewed them as the inevitable consequence of british occupation
this philosophy was more attractive to <unk> and some of them joined the provisional ira
the deaths of two leading <unk> in a premature explosion in june <year> resulted in young militants becoming more prominent in the organization
nevertheless up to july <year> the provisional ira remained numerically small
two men <unk> <unk> and desmond beattie were shot dead in separate incidents in the early morning and afternoon of <num> july <year>
they were the first people to be killed by the british army in derry
in both cases the british army claimed that the men were attacking them with guns or bombs while <unk> insisted that both were unarmed
the social democratic and labour party <unk> the newly formed party of which john hume and ivan cooper were leading members withdrew from stormont in protest but among residents there was a perception that moderate policies had failed
the result was a surge of support for the ira
the <unk> held a meeting the following sunday at which they called on people to join the ira
following the meeting people <unk> up to join and there was large @-@ scale rioting
the british army post at <unk> 's lane came under sustained attack and troops there and around the city came under fire from the ira
in derry residents came out onto the streets to resist the arrests and fewer people were taken there than elsewhere nevertheless leading figures including seán keenan and johnnie white were interned
in response barricades were erected once again and the third free derry came into existence
unlike its predecessors this free derry was marked by a strong ira presence both official and provisional
it was defended by armed <unk> — a no @-@ go area one in which british security forces were unable to operate
gun attacks on the british army increased
six soldiers were wounded in the first day after internment and shortly afterwards a soldier was killed — the first to be killed by either ira in derry
the army moved in in force on <num> august to dismantle the barricades
a gun battle ensued in which a young provisional ira officer eamonn <unk> was killed
a crowd staging a sit @-@ down protest was <unk> down and the protesters including john hume and ivan cooper arrested
with barricades re @-@ appearing as quickly as they were removed the army eventually abandoned their attempt
the derry <unk> had little contact with the ira elsewhere
they had few weapons about twenty which they used mainly for sniping
at the same time they launched their bombing campaign in derry
unlike in belfast they were careful to avoid killing or injuring innocent people
eamonn mccann wrote that the derry <unk> under martin mcguinness had managed to bomb the city centre until it looked as if it had been hit from the air without causing any civilian casualties
although both <unk> operated openly neither was in control of free derry
the barricades were manned by unarmed auxiliaries
crime was dealt with by a volunteer force called the free derry police which was headed by tony o <unk> a derry footballer and northern ireland international
<unk> had organised a march from the <unk> to derry city centre in defiance of a ban on the following sunday <num> january <year>
both <unk> were asked and agreed to suspend operations on that day to ensure the march passed off peacefully
the british army erected barricades around the free derry area to prevent marchers from reaching the city centre
on the day march organisers turned the march away from the barriers and up to free derry corner but some youths proceeded to the barrier at william street and stoned soldiers
troops from <num> para then moved into free derry and opened fire killing thirteen people all of whom were subsequently found to be unarmed
a fourteenth shooting victim died four months later in june <year>
like the killing of <unk> and beattie the previous year bloody sunday had the effect of hugely increasing recruitment to the ira even among people who previously would have been moderates
local feelings changed however with the killing of ranger william best by the official ira
best was a <num> @-@ year @-@ old local man who was home on leave from the british army at his parents house in the <unk>
he was abducted interrogated and shot
the following day <num> women marched to the republican club offices in protest
nine days later on <num> may the official ira declared a ceasefire
the provisional ira initially stated that they would not follow suit but after informal approaches to the british government they announced a ceasefire from <num> june
martin mcguinness was the derry representative in a party of senior <unk> who travelled to london for talks with william <unk> the secretary of state for northern ireland
the talks were not resumed after the ending of the truce following a violent confrontation in belfast when troops prevented catholic families from taking over houses in the <unk> estate
political pressure for the action against the no @-@ go areas increased after the events of bloody friday in belfast
a british army attack was considered inevitable and the ira took the decision not to resist it
on <num> july <year> operation <unk> was launched when thousands of british troops equipped with armoured cars and armoured bulldozers avres dismantled the barricades and occupied the area
over the following years ira violence in the city was contained to the point where it was possible to believe the war was over in the area although there were still frequent street riots
nationalists — even those who did not support the ira — remained bitterly opposed to the army and to the state
many of the residents original grievances were addressed with the passing of the local government northern ireland act <year> which redrew the electoral boundaries and introduced universal adult suffrage based on the single <unk> vote
elections were held in may <year>
nationalists gained a majority on the council for the first time since <year>
since then the area has been extensively redeveloped with modern housing replacing the old houses and flats
the free derry era is commemorated by the free derry wall the murals of the <unk> artists and the museum of free derry

chad bower of about
com stated that the band had progressed a lot since their debut noting that the album was very diverse and allows the band to show many different sides of their musical personality

on a similar note michael <unk> of <unk> said the band is much better at the craft of songwriting than many of their peers
however in contrast reviewer william fry of ign criticized the album saying stone sour doesn 't do anything inspired original or fresh here even calling the album completely misdirected and <unk>
a particular point of interest for reviewers was how come what ever may is more melodic than their previous album stone sour
<unk> of <unk> said the album is much more liberal with the <unk> and acoustic sounds than its predecessor noting on the track <unk> he said it sounds like what nickelback could be if chad <unk> could write a good melody

during chad 's greatest era of instability athletes from the country did not attend the <year> summer olympics in <unk> canada or the <year> summer olympics in moscow ussr although delegations were sent to all other games between <year> and <year>
the largest <unk> delegation to reach the olympics appeared in the <year> summer olympics in seoul south korea and at the <year> summer olympics in barcelona spain each time chad 's national olympic committee sent six athletes

the delegation that arrived in beijing consisted of two athletes — one man <num> @-@ year @-@ old <unk> <unk> and one woman <num> @-@ year @-@ old <unk> <unk> <unk> both participants in track events
<unk> was chad 's <unk> at the ceremonies
up to and including the beijing games there has yet to have been a <unk> from chad

the work presents the view from manhattan of the rest of the world showing manhattan as the center of the world
view of the world has been parodied by ted <unk> columbia pictures the new yorker the economist and mad magazine among others
the work has been imitated and printed without authorization in a variety of ways
the columbia parody led to a ruling by the united states district court for the southern district of new york in steinberg v
columbia pictures industries inc
in favor of steinberg because of copyright violations by columbia pictures
the work is regarded as one of the greatest magazine covers of recent generations and is studied by art students around the world
this is regarded as his most famous work
it is considered an example of unintentional fame steinberg has noted that the type of fame that resulted from the work has diminished his significance to the man who did that poster
the work is sometimes referred to as a parochial new yorker 's view of the world or a new yorker 's view of the world because it depicts a map of the world as seen by self @-@ absorbed new yorkers
at one point the new yorker applied for a copyright from the united states copyright office for the work
it assigned the copyright to steinberg and subsequently reproduced posters of the painting
it is a westward view over <num> avenue
the rest of the united states is the size of the three new york city blocks and is drawn as a rectangle bounded by north american neighbors canada and mexico with a thin brown strip along the hudson representing jersey the names of five cities los angeles washington d

the pacific ocean slightly wider than the hudson separates the united states from three flattened land masses labeled china japan and russia
notably the image depicts the world with a back turned to europe which is absent from the painting
the work is composed in ink pencil colored pencil and <unk> on paper and measures <num> by <num> inches <num> cm × <num> cm

the route begins at an intersection with ny <unk> in the village of youngstown and runs in a general northwest – southeast direction across niagara and erie counties to its east end at an intersection with ny <num> in the town of newstead just south of the village of <unk>
ny <num> serves as a connector between several major <unk> including ny <num> in <unk> ny <num> just west of the city of lockport and ny <num> south of the city
the route was assigned as part of the <year> renumbering of state highways in new york
although it began in youngstown and ended in newstead as it does today the initial routing of ny <num> <unk> from the modern path in the vicinity of the city of lockport
from <unk> to lockport 's eastern suburbs the highway originally used ny <num> lower mountain road <unk> road and a series of streets in lockport
ny <num> was moved onto ny <num> and junction road in <unk> in the <num> and altered to bypass lockport to the south on a new highway and robinson and <unk> roads in <year>
in <year> ny <num> was realigned west of lockport to continue south on junction road to ny <num>
the change removed ny <num> from upper mountain road a county @-@ owned highway that had been part of the route since the <num>
the route proceeds eastward through the village as a two @-@ lane road named lockport street serving two blocks of commercial areas before bending to the northeast and passing into the residential eastern portion of youngstown
at the eastern village limits ny <num> briefly widens to four lanes as it enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with the niagara scenic parkway
past the junction the highway reverts to a two @-@ lane road and changes names to youngstown – lockport road as it runs across the town of porter
the residential surroundings continue to the hamlet of towers corners where ny <num> connects to ny <num> creek road
after ny <num> ny <num> curves to the southeast serving another residential stretch ahead of a junction with youngstown – wilson road cr <num> on the eastern edge of towers corners
after this intersection the homes give way to farms as the road heads into rural areas of the town
the route continues on a southeast track through porter passing a mixture of rural and residential areas on its way into the hamlet of porter center where ny <num> enters an intersection with porter center road cr <num>
another southeastward stretch brings the route across <unk> creek and into the hamlet of <unk> where ny <num> becomes the community 's main street
through <unk> ny <num> retains the youngstown – lockport road name intersecting with <unk> road cr <num> in the hamlet 's business district
just outside <unk> ny <num> leaves the town of porter for the town of wilson
it continues generally southeastward across mostly open terrain meeting randall road cr <num> and church street cr <num> on its way to the town of <unk>
ny <num> becomes north ridge road at the town line and it soon enters the hamlet of north ridge a community built up around the route 's intersection with ny <num> <unk> – wilson road
the hamlet 's residential surroundings continue to the adjacent community of <unk> corners where ny <num> becomes concurrent with ny <num> ridge road
ny <num> and ny <num> proceed northeast across lightly populated areas for <num> miles <num>
<num> km to the hamlet of warren corners at which point ny <num> splits from ny <num> and heads southward along town line road
it immediately intersects with stone road cr <num> before leaving the hamlet
it soon enters the small hamlet of hickory corners where the road passes under lower mountain road cr <num>
access to the highway is made by way of town line road spur cr <num> a connector leading to lower mountain road
ny <num> continues southward along the town line changing names to junction road at an intersection with upper mountain road cr <num> west of the city of lockport
from here the route crosses over csx transportation 's lockport subdivision rail line at the hamlet of lockport junction before intersecting with ny <num> saunders settlement road and ny <num> campbell boulevard just south of the community
ny <num> begins straight ahead to the south while ny <num> turns northeast onto saunders settlement road beginning a concurrency with ny <num>
now fully in the town of lockport ny <num> and ny <num> proceed northeast through an open area of the town as a four @-@ lane divided highway
the two routes continue to the western edge of the city of lockport where they intersect with upper mountain road and the lockport bypass
the overlap ends here as ny <num> turns southeastward onto the two @-@ lane bypass
along the bypass ny <num> briefly enters the city limits as it runs past several industrial facilities and intersects with <unk> road cr <num> just ahead of a bridge over the erie canal
past the waterway the bypass takes a more southerly course through an undeveloped part of the town of lockport to a junction with robinson road cr <num> on the lockport – pendleton town line
the lockport bypass ends here leaving ny <num> to turn eastward onto robinson road
the route initially serves a line of homes as it heads along robinson road however it soon enters a commercial district surrounding the road 's intersection with ny <num> transit road
at this point the lockport – pendleton town line turns south to follow ny <num> leaving ny <num> fully within the town of lockport as it runs eastward past another stretch of homes
not far from ny <num> ny <num> changes names to <unk> road at an intersection with beattie avenue cr <num> and raymond road cr <num>
the junction also marks a shift in the road 's surroundings as the homes give way to open rolling terrain
ny <num> continues eastward for several miles to the town of <unk> where it meets riddle road cr <num> and <unk> road cr <num> at adjacent intersections just east of the town line
here the route turns southward at a junction with bunker hill road cr <num>
outside of <unk> ny <num> heads southeastward across undeveloped areas of <unk> connecting to block church road cr <num> as it approaches <unk> creek and the niagara – erie county line
the road runs along the northern edge of the creek for about <num>
<num> miles <num>
<num> km prior to curving southward at an intersection with <unk> road cr <num>
the turn brings ny <num> across <unk> creek and into the erie county town of newstead where it becomes known as maple road and immediately intersects with cr <num> <unk> road
continuing southward ny <num> runs across open rolling terrain meeting cr <num> <unk> creek road on its way to the hamlet of swifts mills
here the rural surroundings briefly give way to residential areas as ny <num> intersects with cr <num> swift mills road in the center of the community
south of swifts mills the road serves only intermittent stretches of homes for <num> miles <num>
<num> km including a cluster of residences around its closely spaced intersections with cr <num> <unk> road and cr <num> rapids road
it continues on a southward track past the eastern terminus of cr <num> hunts corner – <unk> road to the outskirts of the village of <unk> where the highway turns east onto lewis road and soon enters the village limits
ny <num> runs past a line of homes before intersecting cedar street a road maintained by erie county as cr <num> north of the village
the route turns south at cedar street following the residential street into downtown <unk>
here ny <num> intersects with cr <num> john street at a junction that was once the western terminus of ny <num>
at this intersection ny <num> heads west on john street for one block before continuing south on buffalo street for another block to main street
ny <num> turns westward again following main street through the westernmost part of <unk> 's central business district prior to curving southwestward at a junction with mechanic street
the highway takes on the mechanic street name as it crosses over murder creek and leaves downtown <unk>
just south of the creek ny <num> changes names to <unk> street at an intersection with jackson street
as the route continues southward through the southern part of <unk> it serves mostly residential areas save for an industrial complex at ny <num> 's intersection with cr <num> clarence center road and cr <num> <unk> drive
ny <num> exits <unk> a short distance south of the junction at which point the route heads into another area of open fields while retaining the <unk> street name
it continues on a southward track for about <num> mile <num>
<num> km to a <unk> intersection with ny <num> main road where <unk> street and ny <num> both come to an end
while the termini of ny <num> have remained the same to this day several portions of the route have been realigned since that time
when ny <num> was first assigned it turned south at the hamlet of north ridge and overlapped with ny <num> along <unk> – wilson road to lower mountain road then part of ny <num>
ny <num> went west from this junction while ny <num> headed eastward following ny <num> along lower mountain gothic hill upper mountain and saunders settlement roads to the city of lockport
at <unk> street ny <num> left ny <num> and exited the city along <unk> high and <unk> streets and <unk> road
it met its current alignment southeast of the city in <unk>
ny <num> was realigned c
<year> to follow saunders settlement road between <unk> road ny <num> and upper mountain road
the former routing of ny <num> along <unk> lower mountain gothic hill and upper mountain roads was redesignated as ny <unk> even though all of ny <num> 's former routing was already part of either ny <num> or ny <num>
the ny <unk> designation was eliminated c
<year> when ny <num> was truncated eastward to a new western terminus in central new york
in the early <num> ny <num> was altered to follow north ridge road u
s
route <num> now ny <num> and junction road between north ridge and lower mountain road
around the same time that ny <num> was rerouted ny <num> was also extended northward along junction road from ny <num> to us <num>
as a result ny <num> overlapped ny <num> between lower mountain road and us <num>
the overlap with ny <num> remained in place until c
<year> when ny <num> was truncated southward to the intersection of lower mountain and junction roads
ny <num> was realigned in the late <num> to bypass lower mountain and gothic hill roads on junction and upper mountain roads replacing ny <num> along junction road
the lower mountain road portion of ny <num> 's former routing is now maintained by niagara county as county route <num> cr <num>
the highway cost <num>
<num> million equivalent to <num>
<num> million in <year> to construct and extended from the junction of ny <num> and ny <num> west of the city to robinson road south of downtown
ny <num> was realigned to follow the new bypass south to robinson road where it turned east and followed robinson road cr <num> and <unk> road cr <num> to <unk> road in <unk>
the portion of <unk> road ny <num> 's former routing east of the lockport city limits became ny <num> an unsigned reference route
ownership and maintenance of robinson road from the bypass to ny <num> was transferred from niagara county to the state of new york on september <num> <year> as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government
the portion of ny <num> between ny <num> and <unk> road became state @-@ maintained on october <num> <year> as part of another swap that also transferred ownership and maintenance of <unk> road to niagara county
<unk> road is now cr <num>
on november <num> <year> the niagara county legislature voted on a measure to allow the county to ask the new york state department of transportation <unk> to remove the ny <num> designation from upper mountain road a county @-@ maintained highway and reassign it to junction road ny <num> and saunders settlement road ny <num>
the impetus for the change came from a resident of upper mountain road who demanded that trucks should be removed from the roadway

that day the japan meteorological agency jma classified the system as a tropical depression about <num> km <num> mi to the southeast of <unk> guam
at <num> utc on october <num> the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa began issuing advisories on the depression giving it the local name <unk>
the next day the jma upgraded the depression to tropical storm <unk> <num> and the joint typhoon warning center jtwc also classified it as tropical depression <unk>
by that time the storm was moving steadily westward due to the subtropical ridge to the north
with the warm waters of the philippine sea <unk> wind shear and improving outflow <unk> gradually strengthened and the jtwc also upgraded <unk> to tropical storm status on october <num> after an eye feature developed
while approaching northern luzon on october <num> <unk> quickly intensified as the initial eye feature organized into a well @-@ defined eye
late on october <num> the jtwc upgraded <unk> to typhoon status and the next day both pagasa and jma followed suit
on october <num> <unk> made landfall in northeastern luzon near cagayan and developed a symmetric eyewall while initially moving over land
land interaction weakened the eye by the time <unk> emerged into the south china sea late on october <num>
the next day pagasa discontinued advisories after the typhoon exited the region

late on november <num> a large eye redeveloped and the jtwc estimated <unk> attained peak <num> minute sustained winds of <num> km h <num> mph
early the next day the jma also estimated the typhoon reached peak <num> minute winds of <num> km h <num> mph
later increasing wind shear caused the eye to deteriorate and <unk> began slowing about <num> km <num> mi east @-@ southeast of hong kong after reaching the western edge of the subtropical ridge
after remaining nearly stationary <unk> began moving steadily to the west @-@ southwest due to a new ridge
the convection continued to weaken due to continued shear and cooler waters from upwelling and <unk> deteriorated to tropical storm status on november <num>

it is a breakout clone the player controls <unk> along the screen 's edge to knock a bouncing ball kirby into <unk> bricks
the game 's <num> levels include power @-@ ups bonus rounds and minigames
kirby 's block ball was developed by hal laboratory and nintendo r d1
the team spent half a year revising the gameplay to match kirby 's signature characteristics
kirby 's block ball was published by nintendo first in japan in <year> later in europe and last in north america in <year>
reviewers considered the game an improvement on the breakout formula and praised its gameplay craftsmanship and incorporation of the kirby series
it was included in multiple top game boy game lists and was later emulated on the nintendo 3ds virtual console
the player loses a life if kirby hits the edge of the screen
each of the game 's eleven stages include five rounds of increasingly complex block patterns for kirby to clear
the ten different block types vary in durability and points value
a well @-@ timed hit of the paddle gives kirby a powerful bounce to break through harder blocks
another block type turns the remaining blocks into a bonus round that rewards the player for clearing the screen in the least amount of time
the player can find warp stars that lead to minigames such as air hockey where the player can earn extra lives
the rounds also include enemies to attack and avoid
some enemies contain bonus items
each stage ends in a boss fight
with stone needle flame and spark power @-@ ups kirby can transform to interact with blocks differently
for instance the spark power @-@ up lets kirby break through otherwise <unk> blocks and the needle lets kirby hit spikes once without losing a life
the game has a themed frame and uses a wide palette of colors in @-@ game when played with the super game boy
at one point in development hal decided that the game did not feel like a kirby game
the team spent six months completely revising the game under explicit instructions on how kirby should move
kirby games contain elements of unrestricted creative movement as a general theme
kirby 's block ball was released for the game boy first in japan in <year> and later in europe <year> and north america may <year>
it was later emulated on the nintendo 3ds virtual console and released first in japan october <year> and later in europe february <year> and north america may <year>
they especially praised the unique power @-@ ups though crispin boyer and sushi x also felt the game was too short and easy
nintendo power said they enjoyed block ball and its number of stages but wondered how its eight megabits of memory were being used
the magazine found the parts where kirby eats the unbreakable blocks to be innovative
all six of the magazine 's reviewers recommended the game
ign wrote that the game was primarily remembered as an <unk> or breakout clone skinned with the kirby franchise
ign calculated an average reviewer score of <num>
<num> <num>
the kirby series became known for its number of non @-@ platformer spin @-@ offs of which block ball was one like kirby 's <unk> land and kirby 's dream course
kirby 's spherical shape lent itself towards ball @-@ like roles
ign wrote that block ball was the first truly out there kirby spin @-@ off but that the game was too short
planet game boy called it one of the original game boy 's ten all @-@ time classics and gamesradar placed it among the top <num> game boy games released
they considered kirby 's block ball an improvement upon <unk> a game boy launch title and breakout clone
ign recommended the game upon its 3ds <unk> both in general and for breakout fans
nintendo world report recommended the game to players who like score attack games and called it the best version of breakout released
retrospective reviewers found the game enjoyable and praised the craft behind the gameplay and kirby themes
alternatively kirby 's block ball received the lowest rating on tim rogers 's <year> <unk> scoring system for portable games a metric by which he played a game while counting stops on the circular <unk> train line until he lost interest with a score of one stop
he called it too damned bland
in a retrospective review <unk>
com had high praise for the level design graphics and animations
they also found the music excellent in comparison to the annoying and repetitive soundtrack of most breakout clones
the magazine also liked how the game fit the kirby universe apart from its increased difficulty — <unk>
com occasionally had trouble hitting the slow @-@ paced ball with precision

the commission is also responsible for commemorating commonwealth civilians who died as a result of enemy action during world war ii
the commission was founded by fabian ware and constituted through royal charter in <year> named the imperial war graves commission
the change to the present name took place in <year>
the commission as part of its mandate is responsible for commemorating all commonwealth war dead individually and equally
to this end the war dead are commemorated by name on a <unk> at an identified site of a burial or on a memorial
war dead are commemorated uniformly and equally irrespective of military or civil rank race or creed
the commission is currently responsible for the continued commemoration of <num>
<num> million deceased commonwealth military service members in <num> countries
since its inception the commission has constructed approximately <num> @,@ <num> war cemeteries and numerous memorials
the commission is currently responsible for the care of war dead at over <num> @,@ <num> separate burial sites and the maintenance of more than <num> memorials worldwide
in addition to commemorating commonwealth military service members the commission maintains under arrangement with applicable governments over <num> @,@ <num> non @-@ commonwealth war graves and over <num> @,@ <num> non @-@ war military and civilian graves
the commission operates through the continued financial support of the member states united kingdom canada australia new zealand india and south africa
the current president of the commonwealth war graves commission is prince edward duke of kent
he used the influence of rio <unk> chairman viscount milner to become the commander of a mobile unit of the british red cross
he arrived in france in september <year> and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the red cross for this purpose
in march <year> with the support of nevil macready adjutant @-@ general of the british expeditionary force ware 's work was given official recognition and support by the imperial war office and the unit was transferred to the british army as the graves registration commission
the new graves registration commission had over <num> @,@ <num> graves of british and imperial soldiers registered by october <year> and <num> @,@ <num> registered by may <year>
when municipal graveyards began to <unk> ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further cemeteries
ware began with an agreement with france to build joint british and french cemeteries under the understanding that these would be maintained by the french government
ware eventually concluded that it was not <unk> to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the french government and subsequently arranged for france to purchase the land grant it in <unk> and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the british
the french government agreed under the condition that cemeteries respected certain dimensions were accessible by public road were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages
similar negotiations were started with the belgian government
as reports of the grave registration work became public the commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers
by <year> <num> @,@ <num> photographs had been dispatched to relatives
in march <year> the commission with the support of the red cross began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to the requests
the graves registration commission became the directorate of graves registration and enquiries in the spring of <year> in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to enquiries from relatives of those killed
the directorate 's work was also extended beyond the western front and into other theatres of war with units deployed in greece egypt and mesopotamia
following a suggestion by the british army the national committee for the care of soldiers graves was appointed by the british government in january <year> with edward prince of wales agreeing to serve as president
the national committee for the care of soldiers graves was created with the intention of taking over the work of the directorate of graves registration and enquiries after the war
the government felt that it was more appropriate to entrust the work to a specially appointed body rather than to any existing government department
by early <year> a number of members of the committee believed a formal imperial organisation would be needed to care for the graves
with the help of edward prince of wales ware submitted a memorandum to the imperial war conference in <year> suggesting that an imperial organisation be constituted
the suggestion was accepted and on <num> may <year> the imperial war graves commission was established by royal charter with the prince of wales serving as president secretary of state for war lord derby as chairman and ware as vice @-@ chairman
the commission 's undertakings began in earnest at the end of the first world war
once land for cemeteries and memorials had been guaranteed the enormous task of recording the details of the dead could begin
by <year> some <num> @,@ <num> graves had been identified and a further <num> @,@ <num> casualties were registered as having no known grave
the scale and associated high number of casualties of the war produced an entirely new attitude towards the commemoration of war dead
previous to world war i individual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers
however the war required mobilisation of a significant percentage of the population either as volunteers or through conscription
an expectation had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated even if they were low @-@ ranking members of the military
a committee under frederic kenyon director of the british museum presented a report to the commission in november <year> detailing how it envisioned the development of the cemeteries
two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions
beyond the logistical nightmare of returning home so many corpses it was felt that repatriation would conflict with the feeling of brotherhood that had developed between serving ranks
an article in the times on <num> february <year> by <unk> kipling carried the commission 's proposal to a wider audience and described what the graves would look like
the article entitled war graves work of imperial commission mr
kipling 's survey was quickly republished as an illustrated booklet graves of the fallen
the illustrated booklet was intended to soften the impact of kenyon 's report as it included illustrations of cemeteries with mature trees and shrubs contrasting the bleak landscapes depicted in published battlefield photos
there was an immediate public outcry following the publication of the reports particularly with regards to the decision to not repatriate the bodies of the dead
the reports generated considerable discussion in the press which ultimately led to a heated debate in parliament on <num> may <year>
sir james remnant started the debate followed by speeches by william <unk> @-@ <unk> in favour of the commission 's principles and robert cecil speaking for those desiring repatriation and opposing uniformity of grave markers
winston churchill closed the debate and asked that the issue not proceed to a vote
remnant withdrew his motion allowing the commission to carry out its work assured of support for its principles
<unk> kipling was appointed literary advisor for the language used for memorial inscriptions
in <year> the commission built three experimental cemeteries at le <unk> <unk> and <unk> following the principles outlined in the kenyon report
of these the <unk> communal cemetery and extension was agreed to be the most successful
having consulted with garden designer gertrude jekyll the architects created a walled cemetery with uniform headstones in a garden setting augmented by <unk> 's cross of sacrifice and <unk> stone of remembrance
after some adjustments <unk> became the template for the commission 's building programme
adjustments were required because all three experimental cemeteries went over budget
to ensure future cemeteries remained within their budget the commission decided to not build shelters in cemeteries that contained less than <num> graves to not place a stone of remembrance in any cemetery with less than <num> graves and to limit the height of cemetery walls to <num> metre <num>
<num> ft
at the end of <year> the commission had spent £ <num> @,@ <num> and this figure rose to £ <num> @,@ <num> in <year> as construction of cemeteries and memorials increased
by <year> the commission had established <num> @,@ <num> cemeteries which were ready for <unk> erections and burials
between <year> and <year> the commission was shipping <num> @,@ <num> headstones a week to france
in many cases small cemeteries were closed and the graves concentrated in larger ones
by <year> when the majority of construction had been completed over <num> cemeteries had been built with <num> @,@ <num> headstones a thousand crosses of sacrifice and <num> stones of remembrance
the commission had also been mandated to individually commemorate each soldier who had no known grave which amounted to <num> @,@ <num> in france and belgium alone
the commission initially decided to build <num> monuments on which to commemorate the missing each memorial being located at the site of an important battle along the western front
after resistance from the french committee responsible for the approvals of memorials on french territory the commission revised their plan and reduced the number of memorials and in some cases built memorials to the missing in existing cemeteries rather than as separate structures
reginald <unk> 's <unk> gate was the first memorial to the missing located in europe to be completed and was unveiled on <num> july <year>
the <unk> gate <unk> was found to have insufficient space to contain all the names as originally planned and <num> @,@ <num> names of the missing were instead inscribed on herbert baker 's tyne <unk> memorial to the missing
other memorials followed the helles memorial in gallipoli designed by john james burnet the <unk> memorial on the somme and the arras memorial designed by edwin <unk> and the basra memorial in iraq designed by edward <unk> warren
the dominions and india also erected memorials on which they commemorated their missing the <unk> @-@ <unk> memorial for the forces of india the vimy memorial by canada the villers @-@ <unk> memorial by australia the <unk> wood memorial by south africa and the beaumont @-@ hamel memorial by newfoundland
the programme of commemorating the dead of the great war was considered essentially complete with the inauguration of the <unk> memorial in <year> though the vimy memorial would not be finished until <year> the villers @-@ <unk> memorial until <year> and <unk> were still conducting work on the <unk> gate when germany invaded belgium in <year>
the only memorial created by the commission that was not in the form of a monument or cemetery was the <unk> institute at giza egypt — complete with library and <unk> and pathology departments — as its memorial to men of the egyptian labour corps and camel transport corps
its erection was agreed with local political pressure
when the war began turning in favour of the allies the commission was able to begin restoring its first world war cemeteries and memorials
it also began the task of commemorating the <num> @,@ <num> commonwealth casualties from the second world war
in <year> the commission completed <unk> canadian war cemetery the first of <num> new cemeteries and <num> new memorials
eventually over <num> @,@ <num> new headstones were erected
many were made from <unk> wood stone
the wider scale of world war ii coupled with manpower shortages and unrest in some countries meant that the construction and restoration programmes took much longer
following the war the commission implemented a five @-@ year <unk> renovation programme
the <unk> neglect was largely addressed by <year> but there were necessary structural repairs to be made
these together with the <unk> of maintenance tasks from before the war took a further <num> years to complete and the programme was not completed until the <num>
with the increased number of civilian casualties compared with the world war i winston churchill agreed to ware 's proposal that the commission also maintain a record of commonwealth civilian war deaths
a supplemental chapter was added to the imperial war graves commission 's charter on <num> february <year> empowering the organisation to collect and record the names of civilians who died from enemy action during the second world war which resulted in the creation of the civilian war dead roll of honour
the roll eventually contained the names of nearly <num> @,@ <num> civilians
the commission and the dean of westminster reached an agreement that the roll would eventually be placed in westminster abbey but not until the roll was complete and hostilities had ended
the commission handed over the first six volumes to the dean of westminster on <num> february <year> the final volume was added to the showcase in <year>
in the spirit of strengthening national and regional feelings the organisation 's name was changed to commonwealth war graves commission in <year>
more recent conflicts have sometimes made it impossible for the commission to care for cemeteries in a given region or resulted in the destruction of sites altogether
<unk> indian cemetery in germany was <unk> after the end of world war ii and until the german reunification because it was located in an area occupied by russian forces and was not entirely rebuilt until <year>
the six @-@ day war and war of attrition resulted in the destruction of port <unk> memorial and aden memorial and the death of a commission gardener at suez war memorial cemetery
during the lebanese civil war two cemeteries in beirut were destroyed and had to be rebuilt
the maintenance of war graves and memorials in iraq has remained difficult since iran – iraq war in the <num> with regular maintenance being impractical since after the gulf war
the commission has and continues to also provide support for war graves outside its traditional mandate
in <year> the british ministry of defence requested the commission 's assistance to design and construct cemeteries in the falkland islands for those killed during the falklands war
although these cemeteries are not commonwealth war graves commission cemeteries the commission manages the administrative responsibilities of these cemeteries
since <year> the commission has carried out similar management duties on behalf of the british ministry of defence for cemeteries and graves of british and imperial soldiers who died during the second boer war
in <year> veterans affairs canada employed the commission to develop an approach to locate grave markers for which the canadian minister of veterans affairs has responsibility
as of <year> the commission conducts a twelve @-@ year cyclical inspection programme of canadian veterans markers installed at the expense of the government of canada
in <year> an exploratory excavation discovered mass graves on the edge of pheasant wood outside of <unk>
two @-@ hundred and fifty british and australian bodies were excavated from five mass graves which were interred in the newly constructed <unk> pheasant wood military cemetery
this was the first new commonwealth war graves commission cemetery in more than <num> years the last such cemeteries having been built after the second world war
<num> million deceased commonwealth military service members in <num> countries and approximately <num> @,@ <num> civilians who died as a result of enemy action during world war ii
commonwealth military service members are commemorated by name on either a <unk> at an identified site of a burial or on a memorial
as a result the commission is currently responsible for the care of war dead at over <num> @,@ <num> separate burial sites and maintenance of more than <num> memorials worldwide
the vast majority of burial sites are pre @-@ existing communal or municipal cemeteries and parish <unk> located in the united kingdom however the commission has itself constructed approximately <num> @,@ <num> war cemeteries worldwide
the commission has also constructed or commissioned memorials to commemorate the dead who have no known grave the largest of these is the <unk> memorial
the applicable periods of consideration are <num> august <year> to <num> august <year> for the first world war and <num> september <year> to <num> december <year> for the second world war
the end date for the first world war period is the official end of the war while for the second world war the commission selected a date approximately the same period after ve day as the official end of the first world war was after the <year> armistice
civilians who died as a result of enemy action during the second world war are commemorated differently from those that died as a result of military service
they are commemorated by name through the civilian war dead roll of honour located in st george 's chapel in westminster abbey
in addition to its mandated duties the commission maintains under arrangement with applicable governments over <num> @,@ <num> non @-@ commonwealth war graves and over <num> @,@ <num> non @-@ war military and civilian graves
sir robert <unk> was principal architect for italy macedonia and egypt while sir john james burnet was principal architect for palestine and gallipoli assisted by thomas smith tait
the principal architect for mesopotamia was edward <unk> warren
as well as these senior architects there was a team of assistant architects who were actually responsible for many of the cemetery and memorial designs
these architects were younger and many of them had served in the war
the assistant architects were george <unk> gordon <unk> wilfred clement von berg charles henry holden who in <year> became a principal architect william harrison <unk> william bryce <unk> george hartley goldsmith frank <unk> arthur james scott hutton noel ackroyd <unk> and john reginald <unk>
other architects that worked for the commission or won competitions for the commission memorials included george <unk> <unk> harold <unk> bradshaw verner owen rees gordon h
holt and henry philip cart de <unk>
in january <year> edward <unk> was appointed principal architect for the uk
<unk> worked extensively for the commission for <num> years until <year> becoming chief architect and also succeeding kenyon as artistic advisor
together with <unk> the other principal architects appointed during and after the second world war were hubert worthington louis de <unk> philip <unk> and colin st clair <unk>
leading sculptors that worked on the memorials and cemeteries after the first world war included eric henri <unk> charles thomas wheeler gilbert <unk> and charles <unk> jagger
other sculptors both in the inter @-@ war period and after the second world war included william reid dick ernest <unk> basil <unk> alfred turner laurence a
turner walter gilbert henry poole vernon hill robert <unk> bell ferdinand victor <unk> joseph armitage and gilbert <unk>
apart from a few exceptions due to local geological conditions the cemeteries follow the same design and uniform aesthetic all over the world
this makes the cemeteries easily recognisable and distinguishes them from war graves administered by other groups or countries
a typical cemetery is surrounded by a low wall or hedge and with a wrought @-@ iron gate entrance
for cemeteries in france and belgium a land tablet near the entrance or along a wall identifies the cemetery grounds as having been provided by the french or belgian governments
all but the smallest cemeteries contain a register with an inventory of the burials a plan of the plots and rows and a basic history of the cemetery
the register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the cemetery entrance or in a shelter within the cemetery
more recently in larger sites a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign
the headstones within the cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size
the cemetery grounds are except in drier climates grass covered with a floral border around the headstones
there is also an absence of any paving between the <unk> rows which is intended to make the cemetery feel like a traditional walled garden where visitors could experience a sense of peace
however carter and jackson argue that the uniform aesthetics are designed to evoke a positive experience which deliberately masks and <unk> the nature of the war deaths
this cross was designed to imitate medieval crosses found in <unk> in england with proportions more commonly seen in the celtic cross
the cross is normally a freestanding four @-@ point limestone latin cross mounted on an octagonal base and ranging in height from <num> to <num> feet
a bronze <unk> blade down is embedded on the face of the cross
this cross represents the faith of the majority of the dead and the sword represents the military character of the cemetery intended to link british soldiers and the christian concept of self @-@ sacrifice
cemeteries with more than <num> burials typically have a stone of remembrance designed by edwin <unk> with the inscription their name <unk> for <unk>
the concept of the stone of remembrance stone was developed by <unk> kipling to commemorate those of all faiths and none respectively
in contrast to the cross of sacrifice the design for the stone deliberately avoided shapes associated with particular religions
the geometry of the structure was based on studies of the <unk>
each stone is <num>
<num> metres <num> ft long and <num>
<num> metres <num>
<num> ft high
the shape of the stone has been compared both to that of a sarcophagus and an altar
the feature was designed using the principle of <unk>
the subtle curves in the design if extended would form a sphere <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> inches <num>
<num> m in diameter
each <unk> contains the national emblem or regimental badge rank name unit date of death and age of each casualty inscribed above an appropriate religious symbol and a more personal dedication chosen by relatives
the headstones use a standard upper case lettering designed by macdonald gill
individual graves are arranged where possible in straight rows and marked by uniform headstones the vast majority of which are made of portland stone
the original <unk> dimensions were <num> centimetres <num> in tall <num> cm <num> in wide and <num>
<num> cm <num>
<num> in thick
most headstones are inscribed with a cross except for those deceased known to be atheist or non @-@ christian
in the case of burials of victoria cross or george cross recipients the regimental badge is supplemented by the victoria cross or george cross emblem
sometimes a soldier employed a pseudonym because they were too young to serve or were sought by law enforcement in such cases their primary name is shown along with the notation served as
many headstones are for unidentified casualties they consequently bear only what could be discovered from the body
the epitaph developed by <unk> kipling that appears on the graves of unidentified soldiers for which no details are known is a soldier of the great war known unto god
some headstones bear the text believed to be buried in this cemetery when they are believed to be buried in the cemetery but the exact location of the grave is not known
in some cases soldiers were buried in collective graves and distinguishing one body from another was not possible and thus one <unk> covers more than one grave
the <unk> does not denote any specific details of the death except for its date and even then only if it is known and are deliberately ambiguous about the cause of death
due to local conditions it was sometimes necessary for the commission to deviate from its standard design
in places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes such as thailand and turkey stone @-@ faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal headstones
these measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into sodden ground
in italy headstones were carved from <unk> <unk> limestone because it was in more plentiful supply
in <unk> military cemetery in greece to avoid risk of earthquake damage small headstones are laid flat on the ground
the smaller size of the markers mean that they often lack unit insignia
originally the <unk> concept was to create an environment where visitors could experience a sense of peace in a setting in contrast to traditionally bleak graveyards
recommendations given by arthur william hill the assistant director of the royal botanical gardens at kew enabled the commission to develop cemetery layouts and architectural structures that took into account the placement of suitable plant life
combining structural and <unk> elements was not unfamiliar to the commission 's architects
sir edwin <unk> furthered his long @-@ standing working relationship with <unk> gertrude jekyll whose devotion to traditional cottage garden plants and roses greatly influenced the appearance of the cemeteries
where possible indigenous plants were utilised to enhance sentimental associations with the gardens of home
variety in texture height and timing of floral display were equally important <unk> considerations
the beds around each <unk> are planted with a mixture of <unk> roses and herbaceous <unk>
low @-@ growing plants are chosen for areas immediately in front of headstones ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from splashing back during rain
in cemeteries where there are pedestal grave markers dwarf varieties of plants are used instead
the absence of any form of paving between the <unk> rows contributes to the simplicity of the cemetery designs
lawn paths add to the garden ambiance and are irrigated during the dry season in countries where there is insufficient rain
where irrigation is inappropriate or impractical dry landscaping is an ecological alternative favoured by the commission 's <unk> as is the case in iraq
drier areas require a different approach not only for lawns but also to plants and styles of planting
similarly there are separate <unk> considerations in tropical climates
when many cemeteries are concentrated within a limited area like along the western front or gallipoli peninsula mobile teams of gardeners operate from a local base
elsewhere larger cemeteries have their own dedicated staff while small cemeteries are usually tended by a single gardener working part @-@ time

after <year> no further widespread search for bodies was undertaken and in february <year> responsibility of the cemeteries was transferred to the commission
despite the rigorous searches bodies continued to be discovered in numbers
in the three years following the conclusion of the general search <num> @,@ <num> bodies were discovered
in the mid <num> <num> to <num> bodies were being discovered weekly
the discovery of remains of first and second world war casualties remains a common occurrence with approximately <num> bodies discovered annually

when the remains of a commonwealth soldier from the first or second world war is discovered the commission is notified and a commission burial officer tries to collect any associated artifacts that may help in identify the remains
the details are then registered and archived at the commission 's headquarters
the collection of evidence can include artifacts with the remains anthropological data and dna
the archival records of the commission are open to the public to permit individuals to conduct their own research
investigation of archival records by members of the public periodically result in the identification of previously buried casualties

sergeant leonard <unk> was identified in <year> after a visitor to <unk> british cemetery discovered a <unk> of an unknown sergeant with the hampshire regiment killed on <num> july <year> and was subsequently able to show that only one sergeant from that regiment had been killed in france on that date
the gravestones cemeteries and buildings of the commission are no exception
the commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework are usually the pursuits partaken by young people noting the number of incidents increases when schoolchildren are on school holidays
determined thieves will also steal the bronze swords off the cross of sacrifice which are now replaced with identical ones made in fibreglass
the vandalism of commission cemeteries has also been connected to the participation of commonwealth countries in contemporary conflicts

<num> – <num> was the tenth archbishop of canterbury from <num> to <num>
prior to becoming archbishop he was a monk and abbot of a benedictine monastery
besides his ecclesiastical career <unk> was a writer and riddles he composed survive
another work he composed was on the grammar of the latin language which was aimed at advanced students of that language
he was subsequently considered a saint
his epigraph at canterbury stated that when he died he was in old age so perhaps he was born around <num>
he became a monk at the monastery at <unk> @-@ on @-@ the @-@ hill in the present @-@ day county of leicestershire and then abbot of that house
through the influence of king <unk> he was appointed as archbishop of canterbury in <num> and was consecrated on <num> june <num>
he was one of a number of <unk> who were appointed to canterbury during the <num> and <num>
apart from his consecration of the bishops of lindsey and selsey in <num> <unk> 's period as archbishop appears to have been uneventful
he died in office on <num> july <num>
later considered a saint his feast day is <num> july
these qualities were displayed in the two surviving manuscripts of his riddles and four of his ars <unk>
the ars is one of only two surviving <num> @-@ century latin <unk> from england and was based on the works of <unk> and <unk>
the riddles deal with such diverse topics as philosophy and charity the five senses and the alphabet and a book and a pen
the riddles are formed in <unk>
the grammar is a reworking of <unk> 's ars minor with the addition of information drawn from other grammarians
it was not designed for a newcomer to the latin language but is designed for more advanced students
it covers the eight parts of speech through illustrations drawn from classical scholars although not directly but through other grammatical works
there are also some examples drawn from the psalms
the work was completed before he became archbishop and was used not only in england but also on the continent
a recent edition of his works is <unk> opera <unk> published in <year> with some translations into english and german from the original latin
<num> boats were constructed most of which went into service with the german imperial navy
boats of this design were also operated by the austro @-@ hungarian navy <unk> und <unk> kriegsmarine or k
u
k
kriegsmarine and the bulgarian navy
the group is sometimes known as the <unk> @-@ <num> class after sm <unk> @-@ <num> the class leader
in the austro @-@ hungarian navy it was called the u @-@ <num> class
built to meet the need for small maneuverable submarines able to operate in the narrow shallow seas off flanders the vessels were intended to be quickly constructed then shipped by rail and assembled at their port of operation
the design effort began in mid @-@ august <year> and by mid @-@ october the first <num> boats were ordered from two german shipyards
the german imperial navy subsequently ordered an additional pair of boats to replace two sold to austria @-@ hungary who ordered a further three boats in april <year>
a total of <num> <unk> is were built
construction of the first boats for germany began in early november <year> all <num> were completed by october <year>
several of the first boats underwent trials in german home waters but the rest were assembled and tested at either antwerp or pola
the german boats operated primarily in the flanders baltic and constantinople flotillas
the boats were about <num> metres <num> ft long and displaced <num> tonnes <num> long tons when surfaced and <num> tonnes <num> long tons while submerged
all had two bow torpedo tubes and two torpedoes and were equipped with a deck @-@ mounted machine gun
in <year> four of the surviving german boats were converted into coastal minelayers
of the seventeen boats in german service two were sold to austria @-@ hungary one was sold to bulgaria and nine were lost during the war
one of the five austro @-@ hungarian boats was sunk and another mined and not repaired
the five surviving german boats the four surviving austro @-@ hungarian boats and the bulgarian boat were all turned over to the allies after the end of the war and were broken up
by <num> august <year> two weeks after the german invasion of belgium the planning of a series of small coastal submarines had already begun
the german imperial navy stipulated that the submarines must be transportable by rail which imposed a maximum diameter of <num>
<num> metres <num> ft <num> in
the rushed planning effort — which had been assigned the name project <num> — resulted in the type <unk> i design created specifically for operation from flanders
the boats were to be about <num> metres <num> ft long and to displace about <num> tonnes <num> long tons with two bow torpedo tubes
boats of the type <unk> i design were built by two manufacturers germaniawerft of kiel and ag <unk> of bremen which led to some variations in boats from the two shipyards
the eight germaniawerft @-@ built boats were slightly longer at <num>
<num> metres <num> ft <num> in length overall while the twelve <unk> @-@ built boats came in <num> centimetres <num>
<num> in shorter than their counterparts
all were <num>
<num> metres <num> ft <num> in abeam and had a draft of <num>
<num> metres <num> ft <num> in
the boats all displaced <num> tonnes <num> long tons while surfaced but differed slightly in displacement submerged
the slightly longer germaniawerft boats displaced <num> tonnes <num> long tons while submerged as they weighed <num> <unk> <num>
<num> long tons more than the <unk> boats
the <unk> of the boats consisted of a single propeller shaft driven by a <unk> germaniawerft or <unk> <unk> diesel engine on the surface or a siemens @-@ <unk> electric motor for underwater travel
the <unk> boats were capable of nearly <num>
<num> knots <num>
<num> km h <num>
<num> mph on the surface and a little more than <num> knots <num> km h <num>
<num> mph submerged
the germaniawerft boats were about <num> knot <num>
<num> km h <num>
<num> mph slower than their bremen @-@ made counterparts
the boats were equipped with two <num> @-@ <unk> <num>
<num> in bow torpedo tubes and carried two torpedoes
they were also armed with a single <num> @-@ millimetre <num>
<num> in machine gun affixed to the deck
eight boats — numbered <unk> @-@ <num> to <unk> @-@ <num> — were ordered from germaniawerft of kiel and seven boats — numbered <unk> @-@ <num> to u @-@ <num> — from ag <unk> of bremen
after two of the class <unk> @-@ <num> and <unk> @-@ <num> were sold in february <year> to ally austria @-@ hungary becoming u @-@ <num> and u @-@ <num> in the austro @-@ hungarian navy the german imperial navy ordered <unk> @-@ <num> and <unk> @-@ <num> from <unk>
a further three for austria @-@ hungary — u @-@ <num> u @-@ <num> and u @-@ <num> — had been ordered from <unk> by april bringing the total number constructed to <num>
<unk> @-@ <num> and <unk> @-@ <num> were laid down on <num> november <year> at the germaniawerft yard at kiel
<unk> @-@ <num> was launched on <num> january <year> just <num> working days later
<unk> @-@ <num> 's launch followed on <num> february
among the <unk> boats <unk> @-@ <num> was laid down first on <num> november <year> and launched on <num> february <year> a week ahead of <unk> @-@ <num>
these first three boats launched underwent trials in home waters but most of the other members of the class were shipped via rail and underwent trials at their assembly point
the process of shipping the submarines by rail involved breaking the submarines down into what was essentially a knock down kit
each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway <unk>
type <unk> i boats destined for service with the flanders flotilla made a five @-@ day journey to antwerp for the <unk> to three @-@ week assembly process
after assembly at antwerp the boats were towed by barge to bruges for trials
boats selected for service in the mediterranean were sent to the austro @-@ hungarian port of pola for assembly
the total time from departure of the railcars from the shipyard to operational readiness for the boats was about six weeks
by july <year> all seventeen of the german imperial navy type <unk> is had been completed
according to authors r
h
gibson and maurice <unk> in their <year> book the german submarine war <year> – <year> the <unk> did not have enough power to chase down steamers while surfaced and lacked the endurance to spend any extended amount of time underwater exhausting their batteries after little over an hour 's running
in @-@ service use revealed another problem with a single propeller shaft engine combination if either component failed the u @-@ boat was almost totally disabled
another reported problem with the type <unk> is was the tendency to break trim after the firing of torpedoes
the boats were equipped with compensating tanks designed to flood and offset the loss of the c <num> torpedo 's <num> @,@ <num> @-@ pound <num> kg weight but this system did not always function properly as a result when firing from periscope depth the boat could broach after firing or if too much weight was taken on <unk> to the depths
when <unk> @-@ <num> torpedoed and sank italian submarine <unk> in june <year> the tank failed to properly compensate forcing the entire crew to run to the stern to offset the trim imbalance
despite the problems the tin <unk> as the germans referred to them were in active service from march <year> through the end of the war with half of the <num> boats lost during the war
boats of the class served in three navies the german imperial navy the austro @-@ hungarian navy and the bulgarian navy
in german service they served primarily in the flanders flotilla the baltic flotilla and the constantinople flotilla
by the end of april five more type <unk> i boats had become operational

<unk> @-@ <num> departed on the first patrol from flanders on <num> april and was responsible for sinking the first ship sent down by the flotilla
the type <unk> i boats of the flanders flotilla originally patrolled the area between the united kingdom and the netherlands but began patrolling the english channel after <unk> @-@ <num> pioneered a route past british antisubmarine nets and mines in the straits of dover in late june
over the type <unk> is first year of service <unk> @-@ <num> and <unk> @-@ <num> were both lost and <unk> @-@ <num> and <unk> @-@ <num> were transferred to the baltic flotilla
in march <year> <unk> @-@ <num> ran aground in dutch waters and was interned for the rest of the war along with her crew
the four remaining type <unk> is in flanders — <unk> @-@ <num> <unk> @-@ <num> <unk> @-@ <num> <unk> @-@ <num> — were all converted to minelayers by <year> having their torpedo tubes removed and replaced with chutes to carry up to eight mines
all but <unk> @-@ <num> were lost in <year> <unk> @-@ <num> in poor repair and out of service was scuttled in october <year> when the germans evacuated from flanders
all three became training boats at kiel in <year> joining <unk> @-@ <num> in that duty
little information is available about the type <unk> i boats operating in the baltic
all were sent to pola for assembly and trials there as part of the pola flotilla before sailing on to join the constantinople flotilla
<unk> @-@ <num> disappeared en route to constantinople in may <year> but the other three arrived there by mid @-@ june
the three type <unk> i boats of the constantinople flotilla seem to have patrolled primarily in the black sea

during world war ii gibraltar served a vital role in both the atlantic theatre and the mediterranean theatre controlling virtually all naval traffic into and out of the mediterranean sea from the atlantic ocean
in addition to its commanding position gibraltar provided a strongly defended harbour from which ships could operate in both the atlantic and the mediterranean
force h under the command of vice @-@ admiral james <unk> was based in gibraltar and had the task of maintaining naval superiority and providing a strong escort for convoys to and from the besieged island of malta
during the course of the war gibraltar came under aerial bombardment from <unk> french aircraft and from aircraft of the italian royal air force regia <unk> based on sardinia
additionally the fortress was the focus of underwater attacks by the italian royal navy regia marina commando <unk> unit <unk> <unk> mas and their human torpedoes
this italian unit was based on the interned italian ship ss <unk> in the nearby spanish harbour of <unk>
a number of attacks were also carried out by spanish and <unk> agents acting on behalf of the german abwehr
inside the rock of gibraltar itself miles of tunnels were excavated from the limestone
masses of rock were blasted out to build an underground city
in huge man @-@ made caverns barracks offices and a fully equipped hospital were constructed complete with an operating theatre and x @-@ ray equipment
operation torch the allied invasion of french north africa in november <year> was coordinated from the rock
general dwight d
eisenhower who was given command of the operation set up his headquarters in gibraltar during the planning phases of the operation
following the successful completion of the north african campaign and the surrender of italy in <year> gibraltar 's role shifted from a forward operating base to a rear @-@ area supply position
the harbour continued to operate dry docks and supply depots for the convoy routes through the mediterranean until v @-@ e day in <year>
the decision to enforce mass evacuation in order to increase the strength of the rock with more military and naval personnel meant that most <unk> some for up to ten years had nowhere to call home
only those civilians with essential jobs were allowed to stay but it gave the entire community a sense of being british by sharing in the war effort
in early june <year> about <num> @,@ <num> evacuees were shipped to casablanca in french morocco
however following the capitulation of the french to the german armies later in june <year> the new pro @-@ german french <unk> government found the presence of <unk> evacuees in casablanca an embarrassment and sought opportunities for their removal
the opportunity soon arose when <num> british cargo vessels arrived under commodore <unk> repatriating <num> @,@ <num> french servicemen who had been rescued from dunkirk
once their own rescued servicemen had disembarked the ships were interned until they agreed to take away all the evacuees
although <unk> was unable to obtain permission to clean and restock his ships and contrary to british admiralty orders which forbade the taking on of evacuees when he saw the mass of civilians pouring through the dockyards he opened up his <unk> for boarding
just beforehand the british fleet had destroyed a number of french warships at <unk> el @-@ <unk> in order to prevent them ending up in german hands
the attack during which <num> @,@ <num> french sailors died led to high tensions which were evident when families were forced at bayonet point by french troops to board taking only what they could carry leaving many possessions behind
however when they arrived at gibraltar the governor would not allow them to land fearing that once the evacuees were back on the rock it would be virtually impossible to evacuate them a second time
crowds gathered in john <unk> square in the centre of gibraltar as the news broke speeches were made and two city councillors accompanied by the acting president of the exchange and commercial library went to see the governor sir clive <unk> to ask that the evacuees be allowed to land
after receiving instructions from london a landing was allowed as long as the evacuees returned when other ships arrived to take them away from the rock and by <num> july the re @-@ evacuation back to gibraltar had been completed
british conservative politician oliver stanley agreed to accept the evacuees in the united kingdom but he argued with gibraltar over the number of people involved
the governor he declared had given the number of evacuees first as <num> @,@ <num> then as <num> @,@ <num> and finally as <num> @,@ <num>
he asked for the situation to be clarified stressing the shortage of accommodation in britain and insisting that only <num> @,@ <num> could be accepted <num> @,@ <num> of whom were to be sent to the portuguese atlantic island of madeira
the situation replied general <unk> on <num> july is that this is a fortress liable to heavy and immediate attack and there should be no civilians here whereas there are <num> @,@ <num>
the <num> @,@ <num> was the number sent to morocco and more would have been sent had the situation there not altered
in london the evacuees were placed in the hands of the ministry of health and many were housed in kensington area
concern for them in gibraltar mounted as the air raids against london intensified coupled with the arrival of harrowing letters describing the circumstances in which the evacuees were living
in september rumours were already circulating among the evacuees and in gibraltar that the possibility of re @-@ evacuating the <unk> once more was being mooted this time the destination being jamaica in the west indies
after much contention it was decided to send a party directly from gibraltar to the island and <num> @,@ <num> evacuees left for jamaica direct on <num> october with more following later on
however petitions followed and the demands were met partly for strategic reasons and the lack of available shipping
the situation at the end of <year> therefore was that approximately <num> @,@ <num> evacuees were in jamaica and a lesser number in madeira with the bulk of around <num> @,@ <num> housed in the london area
the land reclamation commenced towards the end of <year> along with the construction of an raf camp at the north front now raf gibraltar
the raf dispatched their next squadron to gibraltar at this time and it was in september <year> that war with germany was declared and the strong possibility of german submarines concentrating in the strait of gibraltar and using spanish port facilities loomed large in admiralty thinking
so at <num> <num> utc on the <num> september <year> no
<num> squadron raf was ordered to gibraltar loaded to the <unk> with equipment
on <num> september <year> no <num> coastal group was formed as a subordinate formation to hq raf mediterranean in control of no <num> <unk>
the group 's function was the control of royal air force units operating from gibraltar
in late <year> the group was transferred to coastal command
later a combined hq was formed which commenced operations in early <year>
little damage was reported to have been done
on tuesday <num> september the italian stefani news agency reported as a reprisal for the bombardment of <unk> yesterday morning one @-@ hundred @-@ and @-@ twenty french aircraft based in morocco attacked gibraltar
on the same day the united press agency reported the french government has issued an official denial of reports according to which french aircraft were said to have attacked gibraltar
up until now no reprisals have been undertaken
but the united press report ended on an ominous note with french reprisals are imminent
again on the same day the <unk> french government issued orders for the naval base and city of gibraltar to be bombarded
as a result six bomber squadrons of the <unk> french air force <unk> de l <unk> de <unk> and four squadrons of the <unk> french navy marine nationale de <unk> were employed in the operation
the <num> bombers flew from bases in <unk> <unk> in algeria <unk> <unk> and port <unk> in morocco
the french action was approved by both the german armistice commission and the italian armistice commission
no british aircraft were encountered and much damage was done in the area south of the fortress
the south mole and a large ship in the harbour were heavily damaged
in the northern part of gibraltar fires broke out
on <num> september the french returned with a larger force of eighty @-@ three bombers to cause additional damage to the naval base and harbour installations
again aircraft of the british royal air force made no appearance
however the french crews did report encountering heavy anti @-@ aircraft fire
one leo <num> bomber was lost and <num> other aircraft were lightly damaged during the two days of bombing attacks
the british armed trawler <unk> stella sirius was sunk by bombs
the air attack on <num> september was the last by <unk> forces on gibraltar
codenamed felix the plan which was signed by adolf hitler himself was formulated at the highest level of command
with or without permission germany would take entry through spain and attack gibraltar driving the british out of the western mediterranean
the strait would be effectively closed to the allies once gibraltar was in german hands forcing asia @-@ bound allied shipping to steam all the way around africa rather than to proceed to the east via the shorter route through the mediterranean and the suez canal
the rock was to be heavily dive bombed by planes leaving france but landing afterward at spanish air bases
to deny a possible spanish capture of the base the german planners decided that the final attack to seize gibraltar was to be made by german troops alone
diplomatic failure at the highest levels of government prevented the operation from occurring at the beginning of <year> which had been drawn up in detail by the wehrmacht in the summer and autumn of <year>
general ludwig <unk> 's <unk> corps would conduct the actual attack on the rock
the assault forces would comprise the infantry regiment <unk> the <num> regiment of the 1st mountain division <num> medium and heavy artillery battalions three observation battalions three engineer battalions two smoke battalions a detachment of <num> <unk> and up to <num> miniature remote controlled demolition vehicles <unk> packed with high explosives
as part of a combined @-@ force operation the german air force luftwaffe would contribute ju <unk> <unk> <unk> three light aa battalions and three heavy aa battalions
nazi germany 's kriegsmarine would cooperate by using u @-@ boats to interfere with british naval movement and emplacing coastal batteries to further discourage the royal navy
on <num> march <year> with operation barbarossa looming felix was amended to operation felix @-@ heinrich whereby german troops would be withdrawn from the ussr to capture gibraltar
as a result of spanish dictator francisco franco 's intransigence the operation was postponed modified and ultimately abandoned
<num> bombers attacked gibraltar several times mainly in <year>
the last raids on gibraltar were done during the <year> allied landing in algeria when those bombers hit successfully even the <unk> port
the only unit of the regia <unk> royal air force ever to fly the <unk> p
<num> was the <num> long @-@ range bombardment squadron
this unit was formed in may <year> around the first machines that came off the assembly lines
the training of the crews lasted far longer than anticipated and only in june <year> the <num> became operational
the most spectacular raids with the p
<num> bombers were flown in october <year> when several night attacks against gibraltar were undertaken from sardinia
after the armistice of <unk> <num> september the german @-@ allied italian social republic launched at least two raids on gibraltar one on the night of <num> – <num> june <year> with ten sm
<unk> aircraft and another on <num> june with nine aircraft
both sorties were undertaken by the <unk> <unk> <unk> – <unk>
gibraltar was a very tempting target for the italians who saw it as a refuge for british warships and allied merchant shipping
the italian frogmen originally used a spanish villa villa <unk> located two miles <num> km from gibraltar owned by an italian officer who had married a spanish woman named <unk> <unk>
their base was shifted later to the italian <unk> ss <unk> interned in <unk>
the abwehr contacted a spanish staff officer from campo de gibraltar lieutenant colonel <unk> <unk> <unk> a spanish officer member of the <unk> and coordinator of the intelligence operations in the campo to establish a network of saboteurs with access to gibraltar
<unk> <unk> designated emilio <unk> <unk> also a member of <unk> as operations chief of the organisation
most of the recruits for the sabotage operations were spaniards from the campo
a combination of financial reward ideological commitment and some threats and <unk> were used to gather a significant number of agents
according to the british intelligence there were at least <num> spaniards and <unk> involved in the espionage and sabotage operations against gibraltar
sabotage operations were ordered from berlin in the late autumn of <year> but actual work did not start until early <year>
the first operations were unsuccessful
a first attempt to smuggle a bomb into gibraltar was aborted as the timing device was faulty
in february there was a large explosion in the north tunnel and in april a bomb blew up near the airfield
in june <year> however the british intelligence foiled a new attempt by a german agent to attach a mine alongside an allied cargo ship
another attempt failed when <unk> placed a bomb inside an ammunition store but was not able to bring the explosive
it was not until <year> that the operations begun to succeed
in january <year> two spanish agents manage to destroy two aircraft at the north front landing strip
financed trained and equipped by the germans the saboteurs sank the armed trawler <unk> erin and destroyed the auxiliary minesweeper <unk> <unk> which resulted in the deaths of six british seamen on <num> january <year>
<unk> was assisted by the spanish naval commander of <unk> <unk> manuel romero hume who allowed him to beach a rowboat there
the british intelligence was able however to counteract the sabotage operations
in march <year> a <unk> josé key one of the most prominent agents working for the germans responsible for the collection of information on military movements for the abwehr was arrested and executed in wandsworth prison in late <year>
by september <year> <unk> whose activities were closely monitored by the british at that time resigned and left carlos <unk> his second in command in charge of the operations
in late <year> the german headquarters in berlin ordered the sabotage operations being expanded
in early <year> the arrival of an experienced head of abwehr operations in spain improved the outreach of the operations
in march <year> an ammunition dump was blown up by <unk> 's agents
the british growing suspicious of some of the saboteurs banned them from entering gibraltar
this forced the abwehr to ask <unk> for new personnel
a <unk> working on the rock josé martín <unk> was responsible for the explosion and fire at a large fuel tank at coaling island on <num> june <year> this mission however would be the first and the last for <unk> because he was cornered and arrested by british authorities in august when he tried to smuggle a bomb into a weapons magazine inside ragged staff cave
after being sentenced to death he was hanged on <num> january <year> in gibraltar by british executioner albert <unk>
a member of an unrelated abwehr sabotage network luis lópez <unk> @-@ <unk> also arrested in <year> was executed by <unk> on the same day
<unk> himself was put under arrest by the spanish police and <unk>
he would be a free man again in december when he rejoined the abwehr in madrid under direct orders of <unk> <unk> aka <unk> head of the sabotage section in spain
after a <unk> attempt against the life of pro @-@ allied general josé enrique <unk> perpetrated by <unk> <unk> network 's agent juan josé domínguez and a meeting between anthony eden and the spanish ambassador at london <unk> fitz @-@ james stuart abwehr activities around gibraltar came to an end
six men were to be sealed in a cave and left with only enough supplies for a year
the volunteers — two doctors three <unk> and their leader — would run an observation post with one <num> @-@ inch <num> mm by <num> @-@ inch <num> mm slit looking over the harbour and a concealed outdoor terrace over the mediterranean
the team would then wire back all shipping movements to the british admiralty
they were told there would be no way out and anyone who died within the chamber would have to be embalmed and cemented into the brick floor
only if germany was defeated within their first year would they be released
as the threat of invasion was clearly felt in late <year> an idea for a series of secret observation posts first in gibraltar and later in other places like malta and aden was put together under operation tracer
work in gibraltar began immediately under commander geoffrey birley and his chief engineer colonel fordham
the site chosen at lord airey 's battery on the southern tip of the rock already had an existing <unk> scheme for a shelter
extensive trials of the equipment began in january <year> under the eye of mi6 radio expert colonel richard gambier @-@ parry
much thought was also given to the type of men needed for such a strange and demanding task
a member of scott ’ s ill @-@ fated expedition to the antarctic george murray <unk> was called up as surgeon @-@ commander to advise on survival techniques
there were practical matters such as diet exercise sanitation and clothing to consider as well as vital psychology of the personnel
the full team was in place by the end of summer <year> and their cavern fully equipped and ready for occupation
a comprehensive manual was prepared on all aspects of the operation and it was considered that similar secret lookout posts should be prepared throughout the world in the event of future wars
however operation tracer was never needed as adolf hitler turned his attention away from gibraltar and towards the eastern front
the operation had been clouded in mystery until the discovery of papers at the public record office in kew uk
previously in the <num> details of the story were told to a journalist by his intelligence service contacts and he wrote these up as operation monkey yet facts were very sparse
in <year> stay behind cave as it was nicknamed was discovered in gibraltar by the gibraltar <unk> group but no account was ever obtained from anyone associated with the mission
the discovery came about when the group encountered a strong gust of wind in a tunnel
further searching led them to break through a wall into chambers which had never been used and had remained sealed for over <num> years
in november <year> jim <unk> and sergeant major pete jackson senior tunnel guide with the royal gibraltar regiment met possibly the only member of operation tracer still alive when they travelled to meet dr
w
a
bruce cooper at his home in england
cooper <num> at the time provided an opportunity to shed light on the operation with his direct involvement in the mission as a surgeon @-@ lieutenant in the royal navy volunteer reserve <unk>
he recalled stories about his colleagues his training and his feelings about the task
the kriegsmarine tried to isolate gibraltar malta and suez and disrupt britain 's trade routes
more than sixty u @-@ boats were sent to interdict allied shipping in the mediterranean sea
many of these u @-@ boats were themselves attacked negotiating the strait of gibraltar controlled by britain
nine u @-@ boats were sunk while attempting passage and ten more were damaged
an invasion of europe in <year> would be <unk> but the allies could attack the soft underbelly of europe through the mediterranean as prime minister winston churchill put it
devised by president franklin roosevelt and churchill and code named operation torch the plan was to occupy french north africa morocco algeria and tunisia
from these french colonies attacks could be launched that would drive italy out of the war
in july <year> lieutenant general dwight d
eisenhower was appointed allied commander @-@ in @-@ chief of operation torch
churchill placed gibraltar under the command of general eisenhower as the temporary headquarters for this the first large @-@ scale anglo @-@ american operation of the war
he arrived in gibraltar on <num> november <year> to take over not just command of operation torch itself but also military command of gibraltar
general eisenhower stayed at the convent the official governor 's residence but his operational headquarters were in a small chamber in a tunnel in the heart of the rock
in his memoirs general eisenhower wrote the subterranean passages under the rock provided the sole available office space and in them was located the signal equipment by which we expected to keep in touch with the commanders of the three assault forces
the eternal darkness of the tunnels was here and there partially pierced by feeble electric bulbs
damp cold air in block @-@ long passages was heavy with stagnation and did not noticeably respond to the <unk> efforts of electric fans
through the arched ceilings came a constant <unk> <unk> <unk> of surface water that faithfully but <unk> <unk> off the seconds of the interminable almost <unk> wait which always occurs between completion of a military plan and the moment action begins
one hundred thousand soldiers on the high seas in a multitude of transports converged on gibraltar
more than <num> aircraft of all types were crammed into the dispersal areas around the gibraltar runway
fighters had been shipped in <unk> and assembled on the airfield
every available area of storage was taken up with ammunition fuel and other essential supplies
<num> american pilots were housed in the raf messes at north front
on <num> november <year> <num> aircraft from gibraltar landed on captured north african airfields
from their headquarters in gibraltar general eisenhower and admiral sir andrew browne cunningham directed operation torch the first major combined combat operation during world war ii involving american and british forces
this town inside the rock contained its own power station water supply and hospital
some soldiers posted here would not see the light of day for months on end
two canadian engineer companies the only soldiers with diamond @-@ tipped drills and <num> british engineer companies added some <num> miles <num> km of such tunnels a feat thought impossible at the time
that was enough to hold all <num> @,@ <num> troops on the rock
today the rock has more underground tunnels than roads
on board was general władysław sikorski prime minister of poland 's london @-@ based government in exile and commander @-@ in @-@ chief of its armed forces returning from visiting polish troops in the middle east
the aircraft climbed normally from the runway levelled off to gather speed but then suddenly lost height and crashed into the harbour
the <num> @-@ year @-@ old general died along with <num> others
the sole survivor was the czech @-@ born pilot eduard <unk> who was rescued by an raf launch
the bodies of five passengers and crew including sikorski 's daughter were never found
the coffins of general sikorski and his chief @-@ of @-@ staff general <unk> were draped in the polish national flag and lay in state in the cathedral of st
mary the crowned
after a requiem mass the bodies were carried in procession to the h
m
dockyard with full military honours to be shipped to london in anticipation that general sikorski 's remains would one day be returned to a liberated poland
the route to the dockyard was lined by british troops and the coffins carried and escorted by polish servicemen
a popular theory was insufficient technical maintenance leading to <unk> aircraft controls
despite this finding the political context of the event coupled with a variety of curious circumstances immediately gave rise to speculation that sikorski 's death had been no accident and may in fact have been the direct result of a soviet british or even polish conspiracy
as a result a resettlement board was established in november and at a meeting of the board on <num> february <year> repatriation priorities were finally agreed
on <num> april <year> the first group of <num> @,@ <num> <unk> arrived on the rock directly from the united kingdom and on <num> may the first repatriation party left madeira and by the end of <year> only <num> non @-@ priority evacuees remained on the island
in london home @-@ comers were making claims on the evacuees ’ wartime accommodation and <num> <unk> were re @-@ evacuated to scotland and <num> @,@ <num> to camps in northern ireland
although the governor lt
general sir noel mason @-@ macfarlane fought valiantly on behalf of the evacuees and did not accept the lack of accommodation as a sufficient reason for the delays
as late as <year> there were still <num> @,@ <num> in northern irish camps
the last of the evacuees did not see the rock again until <year>
<unk> became emperor at the age of sixty @-@ five after a lifetime of imperial service under nero and the rulers of the <unk> dynasty
under nero he was a member of the imperial entourage and played a vital part in exposing the <unk> conspiracy of <num>
later as a loyalist to the <unk> he attained <unk> in <num> and <num> during the reigns of vespasian and <unk> respectively
on <num> september <num> <unk> was assassinated in a palace conspiracy involving members of the praetorian guard and several of his freedmen
on the same day <unk> was declared emperor by the roman senate
this was the first time the senate elected a roman emperor
as the new ruler of the roman empire he vowed to restore liberties which had been curtailed during the autocratic government of <unk>
<unk> 's brief reign was marred by financial difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the roman army
a revolt by the praetorian guard in october <num> essentially forced him to adopt an heir
after some deliberation <unk> adopted trajan a young and popular general as his successor
after barely fifteen months in office <unk> died of natural causes on <num> january <num>
upon his death he was succeeded and deified by trajan
although much of his life remains obscure <unk> was considered a wise and moderate emperor by ancient historians
<unk> 's greatest success was his ability to ensure a peaceful transition of power after his death thus founding the <unk> – antonine dynasty
ancient sources report the date as either <num> or <num>
he had at least one attested sister named <unk> who married lucius <unk> <unk> otho the brother of the future emperor otho
like vespasian the founder of the <unk> dynasty <unk> was a member of the italian nobility rather than one of the elite of rome
nevertheless the <unk> were among the most esteemed and prominent political families of the late republic and early empire attaining <unk> in each successive generation
the direct ancestors of <unk> on his father 's side all named marcus cocceius <unk> were associated with imperial circles since the time of emperor augustus <num> bc – ad <num>
his great @-@ grandfather was consul in <num> bc in replacement and abdicated and governor of asia in the same year
his grandfather became consul <unk> in july of either <num> or <num> and was known as a personal friend of emperor <unk> ad <num> – <num> accompanying the emperor during his voluntary seclusion on capri from <num> onwards dying in <num>
<unk> 's father finally attained the consulship in <num> under emperor <unk> <num> – <num>
the <unk> were connected with the julio @-@ <unk> dynasty through the marriage of <unk> <unk> 's brother <unk> <unk> and <unk> bassa the great @-@ granddaughter of <unk>
he was <unk> @-@ elect in the year <num> and like his ancestors moved in imperial circles as a skilled diplomat and strategist
as an advisor to emperor nero he successfully helped detect and expose the <unk> conspiracy of <num>
exactly what his contribution to the investigation was is not known but his services must have been considerable since they earned him rewards equal to those of nero 's guard prefect <unk>
he received triumphal honors — which was usually reserved for military victories — and the right to have his statues placed throughout the palace
according to the contemporary poet martial nero also held <unk> 's literary abilities in high esteem hailing him as the <unk> of our time
another prominent member of nero 's entourage was vespasian an old and respected general who had celebrated military triumphs during the <num>
it appears vespasian befriended <unk> during his time as an imperial advisor and may have asked him to watch over vespasian 's youngest son <unk> when vespasian departed for the jewish war in <num>
the suicide of nero on <num> june <num> brought the julio @-@ <unk> dynasty to an end leading to the chaotic year of the four emperors which saw the successive rise and fall of the emperors <unk> otho and <unk> until the accession of vespasian on <num> december <num>
virtually nothing is known of <unk> 's whereabouts during <num> but despite the fact that otho was his brother @-@ in @-@ law he appears to have been one of the earliest and strongest supporters of the <unk>
for services unknown he was rewarded with a consulship early in vespasian 's reign in <num>
this was a remarkable honour not only because he held this office early under the new regime but also because it was an ordinary consulship instead of a less prestigious <unk> consulship making him one of the few non @-@ <unk> to be honoured in this way under vespasian
after <num> <unk> again disappears from historical record presumably continuing his career as an inconspicuous advisor under vespasian <num> – <num> and his sons titus <num> – <num> and <unk> <num> – <num>
he re @-@ emerges during the revolt of <unk> in <num>
on <num> january <num> the governor of <unk> superior lucius antonius <unk> and his two <unk> at mainz <unk> xiv gemina and <unk> <unk> <unk> revolted against the roman empire with the aid of a tribe of the <unk>
the governor of <unk> inferior <unk> maximus moved to the region at once assisted by the procurator of <unk> titus flavius <unk>
within twenty @-@ four days the rebellion was crushed and its leaders at mainz savagely punished
the <unk> <unk> were sent to the front of <unk> while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded
<unk> opened the year following the revolt by sharing the consulship with <unk>
again the honour suggested <unk> had played a part in uncovering the conspiracy perhaps in a fashion similar to what he did during the <unk> conspiracy under nero
alternatively <unk> may have selected <unk> as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status @-@ quo of the regime
the revolt had been suppressed and the empire could return to order
the <unk> <unk> the <unk> calendar records that the same day the senate proclaimed marcus cocceius <unk> emperor
despite his political experience this was a remarkable choice
<unk> was old and childless and had spent much of his career out of the public light prompting both ancient and modern authors to speculate on his involvement in <unk> 's assassination
according to cassius <unk> the conspirators approached <unk> as a potential successor prior to the assassination which indicates that he was at least aware of the plot
<unk> by contrast does not mention <unk> but he may have omitted his role out of <unk>
considering the works of <unk> were published under <unk> 's direct descendants trajan and hadrian it would have been less than sensitive of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder
on the other hand <unk> lacked widespread support in the empire and as a known <unk> loyalist his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators
the precise facts have been obscured by history but modern historians believe <unk> was proclaimed emperor solely on the initiative of the senate within hours after the news of the assassination broke
although he appeared to be an unlikely candidate on account of his age and weak health <unk> was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and childless
furthermore he had close connections with the <unk> dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the senate
<unk> had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of nero he knew that to hesitate even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict
rather than decline the invitation and risk revolts he accepted
the decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war but neither the senate nor <unk> appears to have been involved in the conspiracy against <unk>
following the accession of <unk> as emperor the senate passed <unk> <unk> on <unk> his coins and statues were melted his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records
in many instances existing portraits of <unk> such as those found on the <unk> reliefs were simply <unk> to fit the likeness of <unk>
this allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material
in addition the vast palace which <unk> had erected on the palatine hill known as the <unk> palace was renamed the house of the people and <unk> himself took up residence in vespasian 's former villa in the gardens of <unk>
as an immediate gesture of goodwill towards his supporters <unk> publicly swore that no senators would be put to death as long as he remained in office
he called an end to trials based on treason released those who had been imprisoned under these charges and granted amnesty to many who had been exiled
all properties which had been confiscated by <unk> were returned to their respective families
<unk> also sought to involve the senate in his government but this was not entirely successful
he continued to rely largely on friends and advisors that were known and trusted and by maintaining friendly relations with the pro @-@ <unk> faction of the senate he incurred hostility which may have been the cause for at least one conspiracy against his life
having been proclaimed emperor solely on the initiative of the senate <unk> had to introduce a number of measures to gain support among the roman populace
as was custom by this time a change of emperor was expected to bring with it a generous payment of gifts and money to the people and the army
accordingly a <unk> of <num> <unk> per head was bestowed upon the citizens while the soldiers of the praetorian guard received a <unk> which may have amounted to as much as <num> <unk> per person
this was followed by a string of economic reforms intended to alleviate the burden of taxation from the most <unk> romans
to the poorest <unk> granted <unk> of land worth up to <num> million <unk>
he exempted parents and their children from a <num> inheritance tax and he made loans to italian landowners on the condition that they pay interest of <num> to their municipality to support the children of <unk> families <unk> schemes which were later expanded by trajan antoninus pius and marcus aurelius
furthermore numerous taxes were remitted and privileges granted to roman provinces
namely he probably abolished the <unk> <unk> the additional tax which all jews throughout the empire had to pay some of his coins bear the legend <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> abolition of malicious prosecution regarding the jewish tax
before long <unk> 's expenses strained the economy of rome and although perhaps not ruinous to the extent once suggested by <unk> necessitated the formation of a special commission of economy to drastically reduce expenditures
the most superfluous religious sacrifices games and horse races were abolished while new income was generated from <unk> 's former possessions including the <unk> of ships estates and even furniture
large amounts of money were obtained from <unk> 's silver and gold statues and <unk> forbade that similar images be made in his honor
because he reigned only briefly <unk> 's public works were few instead completing projects which had been initiated under <unk> rule
this included extensive repairs to the roman road system and the expansion of the aqueducts
the latter program was headed by the former consul sextus julius <unk> who helped to put an end to abuses and later published a significant work on rome 's water supply de <unk> <unk> <unk>
the only major landmarks constructed under <unk> were a granary known as the <unk> <unk> and a small imperial forum begun by <unk> which linked the forum of augustus to the temple of peace
little remains partly because the via <unk> <unk> <unk> cuts across it
in an attempt to appease the soldiers of the praetorian guard <unk> had dismissed their prefect titus <unk> <unk> — one of the chief conspirators against <unk> — and replaced him with a former commander <unk> <unk>
likewise the generous <unk> bestowed upon the soldiers following his accession was expected to swiftly silence any protests against the violent regime change
the <unk> considered these measures insufficient however and demanded the execution of <unk> 's assassins which <unk> refused
continued dissatisfaction with this state of affairs would ultimately lead to the <unk> crisis of <unk> 's reign
while the swift transfer of power following <unk> 's death had prevented a civil war from erupting <unk> 's position as an emperor soon proved too vulnerable and his benign nature turned into a reluctance to assert his authority
upon his accession he had ordered a halt to treason trials but at the same time allowed the prosecution of <unk> by the senate to continue
this measure led to chaos as everyone acted in his own interests while trying to settle scores with personal enemies leading the consul <unk> to famously remark that <unk> 's tyranny was ultimately preferable to <unk> 's anarchy
early in <num> a conspiracy led by the senator <unk> <unk> piso crassus <unk> <unk> failed but once again <unk> refused to put the conspirators to death much to the disapproval of the senate
the situation was further aggravated by the absence of a clear successor made more pressing because of <unk> 's old age and sickness
he had no natural children of his own and only distant relatives who were unsuited for political office
a successor would have to be chosen from among the governors or generals in the empire and it appears that by <num> <unk> was considering to adopt marcus cornelius <unk> <unk> maternus the powerful governor of syria
this was covertly opposed by those who supported the more popular military commander marcus <unk> <unk> commonly known as trajan a general of the armies at the german frontier
in october <num> these tensions came to a head when the praetorian guard led by <unk> <unk> laid siege to the imperial palace and took <unk> hostage
he was forced to submit to their demands agreeing to hand over those responsible for <unk> 's death and even giving a speech <unk> the rebellious <unk>
titus <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 's former chamberlain were sought out and killed
<unk> was unharmed in this assault but his authority was damaged beyond repair
he realized that his position was no longer <unk> without the support of an heir who had the approval of both the army and the people
shortly thereafter he announced the adoption of trajan as his successor and with this decision all but abdicated
trajan was formally bestowed with the title of caesar and shared the consulship with <unk> in <num> contrary to the view here popularized by cassius <unk> however <unk> had in fact little choice with regard to his successor
faced with a major crisis he desperately needed the support of a man who could restore his damaged reputation
the only candidate with sufficient military experience <unk> ancestry and connections was trajan
likewise edward gibbon 's assertion that <unk> <unk> established a tradition of succession through adoption among the five good emperors has found little support among modern historians
shortly thereafter he was struck by a fever and died at his villa in the gardens of <unk> on <num> january
he was deified by the senate and his ashes were laid to rest in the mausoleum of augustus
<unk> was succeeded without incident by his adopted son trajan who was greeted by the roman populace with much enthusiasm
according to pliny the younger trajan dedicated a temple in honour of <unk> yet no trace of it has ever been found nor was a commemorative series of coins for the deified <unk> issued until ten years after his death
according to cassius <unk> however the guard prefect responsible for the mutiny against <unk> <unk> <unk> was dismissed upon trajan 's accession
due to the lack of written sources on this period much of <unk> 's life has remained obscure
the most substantial surviving account of the reign of <unk> was written by the <num> @-@ century historian cassius <unk>
his roman history which spans nearly a millennium from the arrival of <unk> in italy until the year <num> was composed more than one hundred years after <unk> had died
further details are added by an abridged biography from the epitome de <unk> a work alleged to have been authored by the <num> @-@ century historian aurelius victor
a more comprehensive text presumed to describe the life of <unk> in closer detail is the histories by the contemporary historian <unk>
the histories is an account of the history of rome covering three decades from the suicide of emperor nero in <num> until the death of <unk> in <num>
unfortunately a substantial part of the work has been lost with only the first five books covering the year of the four emperors remaining
in the introduction to his biography of gnaeus julius agricola however <unk> speaks highly of <unk> describing his reign as the dawn of a most happy age when <unk> caesar blended things once irreconcilable sovereignty and freedom
the surviving histories speak equally positively of <unk> 's brief reign although none offer a substantial commentary on his policies
both cassius <unk> and aurelius victor emphasize his wisdom and moderation with <unk> commending his decision to adopt trajan as his heir
these views were later popularized by the <num> @-@ century historian edward gibbon in his history of the decline and fall of the roman empire
gibbon considered <unk> the first of the five good emperors five successive rulers under whom the roman empire was governed by absolute power under the guidance of wisdom and virtue from <num> until <num>
nevertheless even gibbon notes that compared to his successors <unk> may have lacked the necessary qualifications for a successful reign modern history has expanded upon this sentiment characterizing <unk> as a well @-@ intentioned but weak and <unk> ruler
the roman senate enjoyed renewed liberties under his rule but <unk> 's mismanagement of the state finances and lack of authority over the army ultimately brought rome near the edge of a significant crisis
the mutiny led by <unk> <unk> was never intended as a coup but a calculated attempt to put pressure on the emperor
the adoption of trajan expanded his power base with a respected reliable general as his successor
<unk> concludes that <unk> 's real talents were in fact ill @-@ suited to the <unk> his place in roman history is therefore summarized as a necessary if tumultuous stop @-@ gap before the <unk> @-@ antonine dynasties
it is a fact of irony that even the only major public work completed during his reign the forum of <unk> ultimately became known as the forum <unk> or transitional forum
two modern statues which commemorate <unk> can be found in towns associated with him
there is an equestrian statue in gloucester england a town which was founded in his honour
it is at the entrance to <unk> street
there is also a statue at his alleged birthplace <unk> in italy at <unk> <unk> street
he was also played by <unk> gemma in the <year> film revolt of the <unk>

when taylor was forced to drop out of seesaw because of shooting <unk> on cleopatra newman was freed up to take the role which he accepted after reading just half of the script
no one associated with the production officially notified <unk> or his representatives that he had been replaced they found out from a member of the public at a charity horse race
<unk> filmed the <unk> over six weeks entirely in new york city
much of the action was filmed at two now @-@ defunct pool halls <unk> 's and ames billiard academy
other shooting locations included a townhouse on east <num> street which served as the louisville home of murray hamilton 's character findley and the manhattan greyhound bus terminal
the film crew built a dining area that was so realistic that confused passengers sat there and waited to place their orders
willie <unk> served as technical advisor on the film and shot a number of the trick shots in place of the actors
all of gleason 's shots were his own they were filmed in wide @-@ angle to emphasize having the actor and the shot in the same frames
<unk> in pursuit of the style he termed neo @-@ neo @-@ realistic hired actual street thugs enrolled them in the screen actors guild and used them as extras
scenes that were included in the shooting script but did not make it into the final film include a scene at ames pool hall establishing that eddie is on his way to town originally slated to be the first scene of the film and a longer scene of preacher talking to bert at johnny 's bar which establishes preacher is a <unk>
early shooting put more focus on the pool playing but during filming <unk> made the decision to place more emphasis on the love story between newman and laurie 's characters
despite the change in emphasis <unk> still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of eddie 's character and the evolution of his relationship to bert and sarah through the positioning of the characters in the frame
for example when eddie is playing findley eddie is positioned below bert in a two shot but above findley while still below bert in a three shot
when sarah enters the room she is below eddie in two shot while in a three shot eddie is still below bert
when eddie is kneeling over sarah 's body bert again appears above him but eddie attacks bert ending up on top of him
eddie finally appears above bert in two shot when eddie returns to beat fats
describing the film robert <unk> said my protagonist fast eddie wants to become a great pool player but the film is really about the obstacles he encounters in attempting to fulfill himself as a human being
he attains self @-@ awareness only after a terrible personal tragedy which he has caused — and then he wins his pool game
roger ebert concurs with this assessment citing the <unk> as one of the few american movies in which the hero wins by surrendering by accepting reality instead of his dreams
the film was also somewhat autobiographical for <unk> relating to his dealings with the house un @-@ american activities committee
a screenwriter during the <num> and <num> he had been involved with the communist party in the <num> and refused to name names at his first <unk> appearance
ultimately he changed his mind and identified friends and colleagues as party members
similarly <unk> sells his soul and betrays the one person who really knows and loves him in a <unk> pact to gain character
film and theatre historian ethan <unk> has identified the <unk> as one of a handful of films from the early <num> that re @-@ defined the relationship of films to their audiences
this new relationship he writes is one of challenge rather than flattery of doubt rather than certainty
no film of the <num> <unk> asserts took such a brutal clear look at the ego @-@ affirmation of the one @-@ on @-@ one contest at the inhumanity of the winner or the <unk> vulnerability of the loser
although some have suggested the resemblance of this film to classic film noir <unk> rejects the comparison based on <unk> 's ultra @-@ realistic style also noting that the film lacks noir 's <unk> woman or its <unk> in discovering crime among the bourgeoisie hungry bank clerks and lusty wives
<unk> does note that while fast eddie has a slight fifties ring the character makes a decisive break with the extraordinarily feeling tough guys of the rebel era
b ut he does end up seeking out his emotions and telling bert that he is a loser because he 's dead inside

while he found that the script strains hard to give an air of menace and criminality to the pool hall and also declares it full of pseudo @-@ meaning <unk> <unk> <unk> 's sure economical direction especially in regard to gleason who he says does not so much act as pose for a number of pictures which are well arranged by <unk>
it is the best use of a <unk> by a director since kazan photographed burl ives as big daddy
the new york times despite finding that the film <unk> a bit and that the romance between newman and laurie 's characters seems a mite far @-@ fetched nonetheless found that the <unk> speaks powerfully in a universal language that <unk> and reveals bitter truths

<unk> immediately adopted the minnesota fats nickname and <unk> his association with the film into book and television deals and other ventures
